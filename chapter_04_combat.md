# Chapter 4: Combat & Damage

When diplomacy fails, the Rim demands violence. Combat is dangerous, bloody, and often fatal.

---

## The Combat Sequence
Combat is chaotic but structured. We use a **Dynamic Turn System**.

### 1. Initiative Roll
At the start of combat, the Players make a **Group Initiative Roll**.
*   Roll **1d10**.
*   **6-10**: **Players go first**.
*   **1-5**: **Enemies go first**.

### 2. The Flow of Battle
Combat turns **alternate** between sides.
1.  **Side A** (Winner of Initiative) picks **one character** to act.
2.  That character takes their full **Turn**.
3.  **Side B** picks **one character** to act.
4.  That character takes their full **Turn**.
5.  Repeat until all characters on both sides have acted. This completes the **Round**.

*Note: If one side has more combatants, they take all remaining turns at the end of the round.*

## The Action Economy (4 AP)
On your turn, you have **4 Action Points (AP)** to spend. You can spend them in any combination.

### Actions
*   **Attack (2 AP)**: Make a Shooting or Melee attack.
*   **Move (1 AP)**: Move up to your Speed (Default 6 squares).
*   **Minor Action (1 AP)**:
    *   **Aim**: Gain **Augmented** on your next attack this turn.
    *   **Take Cover**: Gain **Edge** on Defense (if applicable) or impose **Bane** on attackers.
    *   **Aid**: Give **Edge** to an ally's next roll.
    *   **Use Item**: Drink a potion, reload, or switch weapons.

### Common Combos
*   **The Skirmisher**: Move (1) + Attack (2) + Take Cover (1).
*   **The Turret**: Attack (2) + Attack (2).
*   **The Sprinter**: Move (1) + Move (1) + Move (1) + Move (1).
*   **The Sniper**: Aim (1) + Attack (2) + Move (1).

## Attack Resolution: "Always Hit"
In this system, **attacks always land**. The question is not *if* you hit, but *how well* you hit.

**The Roll**:
> **2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**

*   **Shooting**: Uses **Dexterity**.
*   **Melee**: Uses **Vigor**.

**The Tiers**:
Compare your total result to the Tiers below.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Weak Hit** | You graze the target. Deal **Half Damage**. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Solid Hit** | You strike true. Deal **Full Damage**. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Critical Hit** | A devastating blow. Deal **Double Damage** AND roll for a **Major Injury**. |

## Damage & Armor

### Calculating Damage
1.  **Determine Tier**: (Half, Full, or Double).
2.  **Apply Armor**: Subtract the target's **Armor Rating** from the damage.
3.  **Apply to HP**: Subtract the remaining damage from Health.

> **Damage = (Weapon Damage x Tier Multiplier) - Armor**

*Example: A Rifle (Damage 6) hits a Raider (Armor 2).*
*   *Tier 1*: (3) - 2 = **1 Damage**.
*   *Tier 2*: (6) - 2 = **4 Damage**.
*   *Tier 3*: (12) - 2 = **10 Damage** + Injury Roll.

### Health (HP)
> **Max HP = 10 + (Vigor x 2)**

### Major Injuries (Tier 3 Effect)
If you land a **Tier 3 Critical Hit**, roll **1d6** for an additional effect:

| d6 | Injury | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-3** | **Bleeding** | Target takes **1 Damage** at the start of every turn until Tended. |
| **4** | **Broken Bone** | Target suffers **Impaired** on all physical actions. Speed halved. |
| **5** | **Concussion** | Target suffers **Impaired** on all mental actions. Cannot use Skills. |
| **6** | **Severed / Lethal** | Target loses a limb OR is immediately **Downed**. |

## Death & Downed
*   **0 HP**: You are **Downed**. You are unconscious and helpless.
*   **Death**: If you take damage while Downed, or if you are not tended within **1 hour**, you die.
