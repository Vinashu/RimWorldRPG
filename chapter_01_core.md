# Chapter 1: Introduction & Core Mechanics

## Welcome to the Rim

You are stranded. You are lightyears from the glitterworlds, on a lawless frontier planet known as a **Rimworld**. There is no government here, no safety net, and no faster-than-light travel to take you home.

### What is this Game?
This is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG), a conversation between friends where you build a story together.

*   **The Storyteller (ST)**: The host of the game. They describe the world, play the enemies (Raiders, Mechanoids), and control the flow of the story. They are not your enemy; they are the director of the drama.
*   **The Players**: You. You each control a **Colonist** (your character). You make decisions, roll dice, and try to keep your colony alive.

### The Rim Experience
In this game, you will tell the story of your colony's struggle and triumph.
*   **Build**: You will construct a base from scratch—bedrooms, freezers, killboxes, and hospitals.
*   **Survive**: You will manage starvation, disease, and mental breaks.
*   **Defend**: You will fight off raids from savage Tribals, high-tech Pirates, swarming Insects, and cold Mechanoids.
*   **Explore**: You will form caravans to trade with neighbors, complete quests, and raid enemy outposts.
*   **Escape**: Your ultimate goal is to survive long enough to build a ship and leave this cursed planet... or die trying.

## The Core Mechanic: The Story Die System

When a Colonist attempts an action with an uncertain outcome—shooting a raider, performing surgery, or negotiating a trade—you make a **Colonist Roll**.

### The Dice
You roll **two 10-sided dice (2d10)**.
1.  **The Base Die** (Any color, e.g., White): Represents your raw effort.
2.  **The Story Die** (Red): Represents the chaotic nature of the Rim.

**The Formula:**
> **Result = Base Die + Story Die + Attribute + Skill Modifier**
> 
*Skill Modifier = Floor(Skill Points / 10)*

### Tiers of Success
The total Result determines what happens. We don't use a binary Pass/Fail. **You almost always succeed, but at what cost?**

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Struggle** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You hit the raider but deal half damage. You bandage the wound but use 2x Medicine. You make the deal but pay 20% more. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Success** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal exactly as intended. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Triumph** | **Critical Success**. You achieve your goal with style. You deal double damage, heal instantly, or get a discount. |

### Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.
*   **Edge (+2)**: You have the high ground, a masterwork tool, or help.
*   **Bane (-2)**: It's dark, you're using a rock as a hammer, or you're in pain.
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The same in the other way around.

## The Story Die Effects

The Red Die (Story Die) adds narrative twists beyond simple numbers.

### Rolling a 1: Twist of Fate
If the Story Die shows a **1**, something unexpected but positive happens.
*   **Effect**: You gain **1 Inspiration Point** OR you gain an **Edge** on your next roll.
*   *Narrative*: You struggled to build the wall (Tier 1), but you found a better way to lay the bricks for next time.
*   *Narrative*: Your shot hit the enemy armour (Tier 1), but you were able to spot a weakness in their armor.

### Rolling a 10: Complication
If the Story Die shows a **10**, something dangerous happens.
*   **Effect**: You suffer a **Bane** on your next roll, or it will affect your stress level or mood.
*   *Narrative*: You shot the mechanoid perfectly (Tier 3), but your barrel overheated. Your next shot will be harder.
*   *Marratove*: You work harder to finish a section of the wall (Tier 3), but you are too tired and feel stressed.

### Inspiration Points
You can spend an Inspiration Point to:
*   **Reroll one die** in a future roll.
*   **Add +1d6** to a future roll.
*   **Avoid a Mental Break** (reduce Stress by 1d4).
*  **Give an edge**: to a colonist.
*  **Give a bane**: to a enemy.

## Time & Scale

Time on the Rim is tracked in specific units to manage survival.

### The Day
A standard day has 24 hours, divided into **Action Slots** for Base Building:
1.  **Morning** (4 hours)
2.  **Afternoon** (4 hours)
3.  **Evening** (4 hours)
4.  **Sleep** (8 hours)
*The remaining 4 hours are for meals and transitions.*

### The Quadrum
A year is divided into 4 seasons called **Quadrums**, each lasting **15 Days**.
1.  **Aprimay** (Early Spring)
2.  **Jugust** (Late Summer)
3.  **Septober** (Early Autumn)
4.  **Decembary** (Late Winter)

### Movement Scale
*   **Combat**: 1 Square = 1 Meter. Base Speed is **6 Squares**.
*   **World Map**: 1 Hex = ~1 Day of travel for a caravan.
