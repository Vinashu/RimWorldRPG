# Style Guide

## Headings
Use Markdown heading levels consistently.
*   `# Chapter N: Title` for chapter files.
*   `## Section Title` for major sections within a chapter.
*   `### Subsection Title` for subsections.
*   `#### Minor Title` for short callouts or lists.
Headings use Title Case and never end with a period.

## Dice Notation
Use lowercase `d` and a clear, consistent pattern.
*   Standard rolls: `NdS` (example: `2d10`, `1d6`).
*   Modifiers: add spaces around operators (example: `2d10 + 2`).
*   Keep rules: write as `3d10 (keep highest 2)` or `3d10 (keep lowest 2)`.
*   Story Die: refer to it explicitly as “Story Die (red d10)” the first time in a section.

## Procedures (Bulleted Steps)
Procedures are bulleted lists using `*`.
*   Start each step with an imperative verb.
*   One action per bullet.
*   If a step is conditional, start with “If …”.
*   Keep wording concise and in present tense.

## Tables
Use Markdown pipe tables with a header row and alignment line.
*   Left-align text columns with `:---`.
*   Right-align numeric columns with `---:`.
*   Include units in headers (example: `Cost (CP)`).
*   Use dice notation in headers where applicable (example: `d10`).

## Examples (Fully Worked)
Every example must be complete and reproducible.
*   Include the inputs (attributes, skill modifier, bonuses, penalties).
*   Show the exact dice results and the math.
*   State the final tier/outcome explicitly.
*   Use the label `**Example: Title**` at the start of the example block.
