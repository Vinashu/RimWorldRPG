# Chapter 6: Colony Management

Building a thriving colony requires more than just survival; it requires industry, research, and expansion.

## Research & Technology
Knowledge is power. To craft advanced items or build complex structures, you must first unlock the technology level required.

### The Research Process
Research is an active task that requires focus and intellect.

1.  **Assign a Researcher**: A character spends an **Action Slot (4 hours)** working at a **Research Bench**.
2.  **Make a Research Check**:
    > **Roll = 2d10 + Mind + Intellectual**
3.  **Determine Outcome**: Compare your result to the Tiers of Success to see how many **Research Points (RP)** you generate.

| Result | Tier | RP Generated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Struggle** | **20 RP**. Progress is slow and frustrating. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Success** | **50 RP**. Steady progress. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Triumph** | **100 RP**. A breakthrough! |

### Modifiers
*   **Bench Tech Level**:
    *   Using a **Hi-Tech Bench** for *Neolithic/Medieval* tech grants an **Edge (+2)**.
    *   Using a **Multi-Analyzer** for *Industrial* tech grants an **Edge (+2)**.
*   **Drugs**: *Wake-up* or *Go-juice* grants **Augmented (3d10)** on research checks.
*   **Mood**:
    *   **Happy (>80%)**: Clear mind. Gain an **Edge (+2)**.
    *   **Stressed (<40%)**: Distracted. Suffer a **Bane (-2)**.
4.  **Unlock Levels**: Spend RP to unlock the next level in a category. You must unlock levels sequentially.

### Tech Categories & Levels
Instead of specific projects, technology is divided into four categories, each with a number of levels. Higher levels allow you to craft more advanced items and build better structures.

#### Neolithic (Levels 1-4)
*   **Focus**: Basic survival, primitive tools, simple furniture, passive temperature control.
*   **Requirements**: None (Campfire or spot on the ground is sufficient for Level 1).
*   **Cost**: Level × 100 RP. (Level 1: 100, Level 2: 200, etc.)

#### Medieval (Levels 1-5)
*   **Focus**: Metalworking, smithing, plate armor, complex clothing.
*   **Requirements**: **Simple Research Bench**.
*   **Cost**: Level × 300 RP.

#### Industrial (Levels 1-6)
*   **Focus**: Electricity, machining, firearms, advanced medicine, microelectronics.
*   **Requirements**: **Hi-Tech Research Bench**.
*   **Cost**: Level × 600 RP.

#### Spacer (Levels 1-7)
*   **Focus**: Advanced fabrication, bionics, power armor, spaceflight.
*   **Requirements**: **Multi-Analyzer** connected to Hi-Tech Bench.
*   **Cost**: Level × 1000 RP.

## Construction
Building structures requires **Materials** and **Construction Points (CP)**.
*   **Construction Speed**: A character generates CP equal to their **Construction Skill × 10** per hour.
