# Chapter 6: Colony Management

Building a thriving colony requires more than just survival; it requires industry, research, and expansion.

## Research & Technology
Knowledge is power. To craft advanced items or build complex structures, you must first unlock the technology.

### The Research Process
1.  **Assign a Researcher**: A character must work at a **Research Bench**.
2.  **Generate Research Points (RP)**:
    > **Daily RP = (Intellectual Skill × 10) + (Tech Level Bonus)**
    *   *Simple Research Bench*: +0 RP.
    *   *Hi-Tech Research Bench*: +20 RP.
    *   *Multi-Analyzer*: +50 RP (requires Hi-Tech Bench).
3.  **Complete Projects**: Once a project's RP cost is paid, the technology is unlocked for the entire colony.

### Technology Tree
Projects are grouped by Tech Level. You must generally complete lower-tier projects before advancing (GM discretion).

#### Neolithic (Tribal Start)
*   **Tree Sowing** (200 RP): Plant trees.
*   **Complex Furniture** (300 RP): Beds, Tables, Chairs.
*   **Passive Cooler** (400 RP): Low-tech temperature control.
*   **Pemmican** (500 RP): Long-lasting travel food.

#### Medieval
*   **Smithing** (700 RP): Metal weapons (Mace, Longsword).
*   **Plate Armor** (800 RP): Heavy metal armor.
*   **Complex Clothing** (600 RP): Dusters, Parkas.

#### Industrial (Crashlanded Start)
*   **Electricity** (1200 RP): Generators, Batteries, Electric Lights.
*   **Air Conditioning** (1000 RP): Coolers and Heaters.
*   **Machining** (1500 RP): Guns (Revolver, Shotgun), Grenades.
*   **Gunsmithing** (2000 RP): Advanced Guns (Assault Rifle, Sniper).
*   **Microelectronics** (3000 RP): Hi-Tech Bench, Comms Console.
*   **Medicine Production** (2500 RP): Craft Industrial Medicine.

#### Spacer
*   **Multi-Analyzer** (4000 RP): Boosts research speed.
*   **Fabrication** (5000 RP): Craft Components and Power Armor.
*   **Advanced Fabrication** (8000 RP): Craft Advanced Components, Charge Rifles.
*   **Bionics** (6000 RP): Craft Bionic Limbs.

## Construction
Building structures requires **Materials** and **Construction Points (CP)**.
*   **Construction Speed**: A character generates CP equal to their **Construction Skill × 10** per hour.
