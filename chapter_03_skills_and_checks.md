# Chapter 3: Skills & Checks

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, you roll the dice.

---

## The Core Mechanic
To resolve any challenge, roll **2d10** and add your relevant **Attribute** and **Skill Modifier**.

> **Result = 2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**

### Difficulty Class (DC)
The Game Master (Storyteller) sets the DC based on the complexity of the task.

| Difficulty | DC | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Routine** | 10 | Climbing a ladder, cooking a simple meal. |
| **Standard** | 14 | Shooting a raider, performing surgery, negotiating a trade. |
| **Hard** | 18 | Hacking a mechanoid, surgery in the dark, hitting a target behind cover. |
| **Extreme** | 22 | Surviving a plague without medicine, convincing a pirate king to surrender. |

### Skill Modifiers
Your **Skill Points** (0-30) determine your modifier for the roll.
*   **0-9 Points**: +0
*   **10-19 Points**: +1
*   **20-29 Points**: +2
*   **30 Points**: +3 (Master)

## Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.

### Minor Modifiers (+2 / -2)
*   **Edge (+2)**: Minor advantage (High ground, good tools).
*   **Bane (-2)**: Minor disadvantage (Darkness, poor tools).

### Double Modifiers
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.

### Cancel Modifiers
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The same in the other way around.

### Major Modifiers (3d10)
*   **Augmented**: Major advantage (Bionics, drugs, perfect position). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Highest**.
*   **Impaired**: Major disadvantage (Blindness, toxicity, suppression). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Lowest**.

*Note: You can not have both Edge and Augmented on the same roll.*

## Pushing Your Luck
Life on the Rim is desperate. You can push yourself beyond your limits.
*   **The Push**: You can voluntarily add **+1d6** to your roll.
*   **The Risk**: If the **d6** rolls a **1**, you trigger a **Panic Check** immediately after the action (regardless of success or failure).
