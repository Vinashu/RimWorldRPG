## Welcome to the Rim

You are stranded. You are lightyears from the glitterworlds, on a lawless frontier planet known as a **Rimworld**. There is no government here, no safety net, and no faster-than-light travel to take you home.

### What Is This Game
This is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG), a conversation between friends where you build a story together.

* **The [Storyteller (ST)](#storyteller-st)**: The host of the game. They describe the world, play the enemies (Raiders, Mechanoids), and control the flow of the story. They are not your enemy; they are the director of the drama.
* **The Players**: You. You each control a **[Colonist](#colonist)** (your character). You make decisions, roll dice, and try to keep your colony alive.

### The Rim Experience
In this game, you will tell the story of your colony's struggle and triumph.
* **Build**: You will construct a base from scratch—bedrooms, freezers, killboxes, and hospitals.
* **Survive**: You will manage starvation, disease, and mental breaks.
* **Defend**: You will fight off raids from savage Tribals, high-tech Pirates, swarming Insects, and cold Mechanoids.
* **Explore**: You will form caravans to trade with neighbors, complete quests, and raid enemy outposts.
* **Escape**: Your ultimate goal is to survive long enough to build a ship and leave this cursed planet... or die trying.

## The Core Mechanic: The [Story Die](#story-die) System

When a [Colonist](#colonist) attempts an action with an uncertain outcome—shooting a raider, performing surgery, or negotiating a trade—you make a **[Colonist](#colonist) Roll ([Skill Check](#skill-check))**.

### [Colonist](#colonist) Roll

**When it applies**
Use a [Colonist](#colonist) Roll for any action with an uncertain outcome.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10**: one **[Base Die](#base-die)** and one **[Story Die](#story-die) (red d10)**.
2. Add the relevant **[Attribute](#attribute)**.
3. Add the **[Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)**.
4. Compare the total to the **[Tier of Success](#tier-of-success)** table.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* **[Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)** = \`Floor(Skill Points / 10)\`. See [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).
* The [Story Die](#story-die) effect applies even if its value is discarded by **[Augmented](#augmented)** or **[Impaired](#impaired)** rolls.

**Example: [Colonist](#colonist) Roll**
Viper fires at a raider with **Dexterity +1** and **Shooting 20 (+2)**. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 6** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 4**. Total = 6 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **13**, which is a **Tier 2 (Success)**. The [Story Die](#story-die) is 4, so no special effect triggers.

### Tiers of Success

**When it applies**
After any [Colonist](#colonist) Roll.

**How it works**
| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You hit the raider but deal half damage. You bandage the wound but use 2x Medicine. You make the deal but pay 20% more. |
| **12-16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal exactly as intended. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You achieve your goal with style. You deal double damage, heal instantly, or get a discount. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* **Double [Edge](#edge)** or **Double [Bane](#bane)** can shift the Tier up or down after you total the roll.
* Combat outcomes are resolved in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md). Colony outcomes are resolved in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Tier 1 (Struggle)**
Sana tries to pick a lock using **Dexterity +2** and **Crafting 10 (+1)**. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 3** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 2**. Total = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = **8**, a **Tier 1 (Struggle)**. She gets the door open, but the picks break and she takes a minor cut.

### Modifiers

**When it applies**
When circumstances help or hinder a roll.

**How it works**
* **[Edge](#edge) (+2)**: Minor advantage.
* **[Bane](#bane) (-2)**: Minor disadvantage.
* **Double [Edge](#edge)**: If you have 2+ sources of [Edge](#edge), shift the result **up one Tier**.
* **Double [Bane](#bane)**: If you have 2+ sources of [Bane](#bane), shift the result **down one Tier**.
* **Cancel**: If you have at least one [Edge](#edge) and at least one [Bane](#bane), cancel one of each. If one side remains, apply **one** [Edge](#edge) or **one** [Bane](#bane).
* **[Augmented](#augmented) (3d10)**: Major advantage. Roll **3d10 (keep highest 2)**. Replaces [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane).
* **[Impaired](#impaired) (3d10)**: Major disadvantage. Roll **3d10 (keep lowest 2)**. Replaces [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane) are additive before you check for Double [Edge](#edge) or Double [Bane](#bane).
* [Augmented](#augmented) or [Impaired](#impaired) replaces the standard 2d10 roll and does not stack with [Edge](#edge) or [Bane](#bane).
* The [Story Die](#story-die) effect always applies, even if its value is discarded.
* Cover, lighting, and terrain sources of [Edge](#edge)/[Bane](#bane) are defined in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane)**
Marla shoots in darkness (**[Bane](#bane)**) but from high ground (**[Edge](#edge)**). The modifiers cancel. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 5** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 7**, adds **Dexterity 0** and **Shooting 20 (+2)**. Total = 5 + 7 + 0 + 2 = **14**, a **Tier 2 (Success)**.

**Example: [Augmented](#augmented)**
Ivo performs surgery with a glitterworld kit (**[Augmented](#augmented)**). He rolls **3d10**: **[Base Die](#base-die) 9**, **[Story Die](#story-die) 1**, and **extra die 7**. He keeps **9 + 7 = 16**, then adds **Mind +2** and **Medical 30 (+3)** for a total of **21**. That is a **Tier 3 (Triumph)**. The [Story Die](#story-die) was **1**, so a **[Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate)** triggers.

### Pushing Your Luck

**When it applies**
When you choose to risk extra [Stress](#stress) for a better outcome.

**How it works**
1. Declare a **Push** on the roll.
2. Roll **1d6** and add it to the total.
3. If the **d6** shows **1**, you trigger a **[Panic Check](#panic-check)** after the action.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Panic Checks are resolved in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Push**
Oren is building a barricade with **Vigor +1** and **Construction 10 (+1)**. He rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 4** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 3** for a total of 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 = **9** (Tier 1). He **Pushes**, rolls **1d6 = 5**, and the new total is **14** (Tier 2). If that d6 had been a **1**, he would trigger a [Panic Check](#panic-check).

---

## The [Story Die](#story-die) Effects

The [Story Die](#story-die) adds narrative twists beyond simple numbers.

### [Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate) ([Story Die](#story-die) 1)

**When it applies**
When the [Story Die](#story-die) shows **1** on a [Colonist](#colonist) Roll.

**How it works**
* Gain **1 [Inspiration Point](#inspiration-point)** or **[Edge](#edge)** on your next roll.
* Resolve the Tier result normally.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The Twist triggers even if the [Story Die](#story-die) result is discarded by [Augmented](#augmented) or [Impaired](#impaired).

**Example: [Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate)**
Tess tries to hack a console with **Mind +2** and **Intellectual 10 (+1)**. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 6** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 1**. Total = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = **10** (Tier 1). She succeeds with a cost, but also gains **1 [Inspiration Point](#inspiration-point)** from the Twist.

### Complication ([Story Die](#story-die) 10)

**When it applies**
When the [Story Die](#story-die) shows **10** on a [Colonist](#colonist) Roll.

**How it works**
* Gain **[Bane](#bane)** on your next roll or apply a narrative complication.
* Resolve the Tier result normally.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Complications that add [Stress](#stress) or Mood changes are resolved in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Complication**
Sana snipes a mechanoid with **Dexterity +2** and **Shooting 30 (+3)**. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 8** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 10**. Total = 8 + 10 + 2 + 3 = **23** (Tier 3). The shot is a Triumph, but the Complication gives her **[Bane](#bane)** on her next attack as the rifle overheats.

### Inspiration Points

**When it applies**
When you gain Inspiration from a [Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate) or other rewards.

**How it works**
* **Reroll one die** in a future roll.
* **Add +1d6** to a future roll.
* **Avoid a [Mental Break](#mental-break)** by reducing **[Stress](#stress) by 1d4**.
* **Give [Edge](#edge)** to a [Colonist](#colonist).
* **Give [Bane](#bane)** to an enemy.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* [Stress](#stress) and [Mental Break](#mental-break) rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Spending Inspiration**
Marla rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 2** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 6** on a Construction check. With **Vigor +2** and **Construction 20 (+2)**, the total is 2 + 6 + 2 + 2 = **12** (Tier 2). She spends **1 [Inspiration Point](#inspiration-point)** to **reroll the [Base Die](#base-die)**, gets a **9**, and the new total is 9 + 6 + 2 + 2 = **19** (Tier 3).

---

## Time and Scale

Time on the Rim is tracked in specific units to manage survival.

### The Day

**When it applies**
When planning colony activities and daily schedules.

**How it works**
* **Morning**: 5 hours.
* **Afternoon**: 5 hours.
* **Evening**: 5 hours.
* **Night**: 8 hours (Sleep/Rest).
* The remaining hour covers meals and transitions.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The day loop procedures are expanded in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Daily Schedule**
On Day 3, Ivo plans **Morning: Hunting**, **Afternoon: Building**, **Evening: Research**, and **Night: Sleep**. Those action slots are resolved using the colony rules in Chapter 6.

### The [Quadrum](#quadrum)

**When it applies**
When tracking seasons and long-term survival.

**How it works**
* **Aprimay**: Early Spring.
* **Jugust**: Late Summer.
* **Septober**: Early Autumn.
* **Decembary**: Late Winter.
* Each [Quadrum](#quadrum) lasts **15 days**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Seasonal effects appear in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: [Quadrum](#quadrum) Tracking**
If the colony lands on **Aprimay 1**, then **Jugust 1** begins on Day 16.

### Range Bands

**When it applies**
During combat scenes.

**How it works**
* **Melee**: Hand-to-hand combat. You are engaged with the enemy.
* **Close**: Short range. Shotguns, pistols, and grenades are strong here.
* **Medium**: Standard combat range. Assault rifles and LMGs are optimal.
* **Far**: Long range. Sniper rifles and artillery dominate.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Entering **Melee** locks you in combat. Disengaging is defined in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Range Bands**
Viper starts at **Medium** range. She uses **Move** to shift to **Close** so her shotgun is in its optimal band.

### Tactical Actions

**When it applies**
On your turn in combat.

**How it works**
* **Move (1 AP)**: Shift **one band** closer or farther.
* **Rush (2 AP)**: Shift **two bands**.
* **Engage**: Move into **Melee** to lock with a target.
* **Disengage (1 AP)**: Leave **Melee** (see Chapter 4 for risks).
* **Attack (2 AP)**: Make a ranged or melee attack (see Chapter 4).
* **Take Cover (1 AP)**: Gain cover within your band.
* **Light Cover**: Grants **[Edge](#edge)** to defense.
* **Heavy Cover**: Grants **Double [Edge](#edge)** to defense.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Action Point economy and free attacks are defined in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Tactical Actions**
Marla has **4 AP**. She **Moves (1 AP)** from Medium to Close, **Takes Cover (1 AP)** behind sandbags, then **Attacks (2 AP)** with her rifle.

### Weapon Range

**When it applies**
When using a weapon outside its optimal [Range Band](#range-band).

**How it works**
* Apply **[Bane](#bane)** if you attack outside a weapon's optimal band.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Multiple Banes can trigger **Double [Bane](#bane)** and shift the Tier down.

**Example: Weapon Range**
Sana fires a sniper rifle (optimal **Far**) from **Close** range. She suffers **[Bane](#bane)** on the attack, which may downgrade her Tier.

### Caravan Movement (World Map)

**When it applies**
When traveling between map tiles.

**How it works**
* **1 Hex** is roughly **1 day** of travel.
* **Roads** increase speed.
* **Mountains** and **Swamps** reduce speed.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Detailed expedition rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Caravan Travel**
A caravan needs to cross **3 Hexes** of road. At roughly **1 Hex per day**, they arrive in about **3 days**, faster if mounts or roads add speed.


# Chapter 2: Character Creation

In RimWorld, no one is a blank slate. Every [Colonist](#colonist) has a history—a childhood on a glitterworld, a career as a space marine, or a dark past as a pirate.

We use a **Lifepath System** to generate your [Colonist](#colonist). You will roll for your background, survive terms of service, and emerge as a scarred but capable survivor.

**Example: The Table**
John is the Storyteller. Mary is a player. They create a [Colonist](#colonist) together using the steps below.

---

## Lifepath Overview

**When it applies**
At the start of a campaign or when a new player character joins.

**How it works**
1. Assign Attributes.
2. Choose or roll a Childhood.
3. Take 1–4 Terms of Adulthood.
4. Roll Personality traits.
5. Optionally swap one trait for a Neutral/Mixed trait.
6. Choose an Arrival Scenario as a group.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The Storyteller can allow a new [Colonist](#colonist) to skip or shorten steps for pacing.

**Example: Lifepath Overview**
Mary follows the steps in order: Attributes, Childhood, one Term, Personality traits, then the Crashlanded Arrival Scenario.

---

## Step 1: Attributes

**When it applies**
At the start of character creation.

**How it works**
1. Assign the array **+2, +1, +0, -1** to your four Attributes.
2. Record the modifiers on your character sheet.

**Attributes**
* **Vigor**: Physical power and endurance.
* **Dexterity**: Precision and speed.
* **Mind**: Intellect and analysis.
* **Spirit**: Empathy and willpower.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* [Attribute](#attribute) modifiers are added to rolls as defined in [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).

**Example: Choosing Attributes**
Mary assigns **Mind +2**, **Spirit +1**, **Dexterity +0**, **Vigor -1**. Those modifiers will be added to her rolls later.

---

## Step 2: Childhood

**When it applies**
After Attributes.

**How it works**
1. Choose a Childhood or roll **1d10** on the table.
2. Apply the listed Skill Points and Trait.
3. If a Childhood grants **+1 [Attribute](#attribute)**, add it to your assigned value.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* **[Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)** = \`Floor(Skill Points / 10)\`. See [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).

| d10 | Backstory | Skill Points | Trait |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Urchin** | +10 Melee, +10 Social | **Scrapper**: Ignore the first [Bane](#bane) in melee combat. |
| 2 | **Vatgrown** | +1 Vigor (Attr), +10 Shooting | **Dull**: +1 [Bane](#bane) to Social rolls, but +10 Mood. |
| 3 | **Noble Scion** | +1 Spirit (Attr), +10 Social | **Greedy**: [Stress](#stress) penalty if owning fewer/worse items than allies. |
| 4 | **Midworld Student** | +1 Mind (Attr), +10 Intellectual | **Fast Learner**: +1 XP gain per session. |
| 5 | **Feral Child** | +10 Animals, +10 Plants | **Wild**: Cannot do Intellectual tasks. |
| 6 | **War Refugee** | +10 Shooting, +10 Medical | **Pessimist**: -5 Mood permanently. |
| 7 | **Caveworld Tender** | +10 Mining, +10 Plants | **Undergrounder**: Immune to "Cabin Fever". Recover [Stress](#stress) indoors. -1 Mood/Day if outdoors > 8h. |
| 8 | **Industrial Orphan** | +10 Crafting, +10 Construction | **Industrious**: +1 [Edge](#edge) to all Construction rolls. |
| 9 | **Sheriff** | +10 Shooting, +10 Melee | **Trigger-Happy**: +1 [Bane](#bane) on Attack actions, but +1 Action Point per turn. |
| 10 | **Pop Idol** | +20 Social | **Beautiful**: +1 [Edge](#edge) to all Social interactions. |

**Example: Childhood**
Mary rolls **1d10** and gets a **6**, making her a **War Refugee**. She adds **+10 Shooting**, **+10 Medical**, and gains the **Pessimist** trait.

---

## Step 3: Adulthood (Terms)

**When it applies**
After Childhood.

**How it works**
1. Take **1–4 Terms**, each lasting **4 years**.
2. **Age** starts at **14 + (4 × Terms)**.
3. For each Term, follow the sequence below.

### Term Sequence

**When it applies**
For each Term you take.

**How it works**
1. **Choose a Career**.
2. **Roll Survival**: \`2d10 + Attribute\` vs **DC 12**.
3. **Apply Survival Outcome**:
   * **Success**: You gain the Career title.
   * **Failure**: You gain a **Scar** or **Addiction** (see below), but still complete the Term.
   * **Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: You gain a **Random Negative Trait** (roll Table B).
4. **Gain Skills**: Choose **2 Skills** from the Career and add **+5 Skill Points** to each.
5. **Roll an Event (1d10)** and apply the listed outcome.
6. **Critical Success (Natural 10)**: Gain a **Random Positive Trait** (roll Table A) in addition to the Event.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* **Skill Cap**: You cannot start with more than **30 Skill Points** in any one skill. If a gain would exceed 30, reallocate the excess points to another skill listed in the same Career.
* **Event Repeats**: If you roll the same Event entry again in a later Term, take the **second** outcome, then the **third**, then the **fourth**.
* **Natural 1 / Natural 10**: On \`2d10\`, a Natural 1 or 10 refers to the **[Story Die](#story-die)** result (1 = Critical Failure, 10 = Critical Success).

**Example: First Term**
Mary chooses the **Drifter** career. She rolls **2d10 + Dexterity 0** and gets **6 + 8 = 14**, which beats **DC 12**. She survives, picks **Social** and **Plants** for **+5 Skill Points** each, then rolls **1d10** for an Event and gets a **10**. She applies the Event result and gains a **Random Positive Trait** from Table A.

### Scars and Addictions

**When it applies**
When a Term Survival check fails or an Event grants a Scar or Addiction.

**How it works**
* **Scar**: Mark a **Painful Scar** and apply its effects in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).
* **Addiction**: Take the **Addicted** trait from Table B and choose a drug from [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Multiple Scars stack.
* If an Event grants a prosthetic or bionic, apply its effects from Chapter 5.

**Example: Scar**
On a failed Survival roll, Viper gains a **Scar**. The group records a Painful Scar and applies the **-1 Mood** effect from Chapter 6.

### Passions

**When it applies**
When an Event grants a Passion in a skill.

**How it works**
* Mark that skill as a **Passion** on the character sheet.
* Passions affect **Session Advancement** (see below).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* A [Colonist](#colonist) can have multiple Passions.

**Example: Passion**
During a Term, Viper gains a **Medical Passion**. At session end, she assigns XP to Medical and gains the Passion bonus described in Session Advancement.

### Career List

#### Space Marine

**Events (1d10)**:
1. **Disaster** — (1) Unit wiped out; gain **PTSD** (Trait). (2) Salvage a shotgun from the wreckage. (3) Lose your left eye. (4) Receive a bionic eye and **+5** to each Space Marine skill.
2-3. **Live Fire Drills** — (1) **+5** Shooting. (2) Gain a **Shooting Passion**. (3) **+10** Shooting. (4) **+10** Shooting and a Shooting Passion.

### [Mental Break](#mental-break) Threshold

**When it applies**
When your [Stress](#stress) increases during play.

**How it works**
* **Default Threshold**: **6 [Stress](#stress)**.
* If your **current [Stress](#stress)** is **equal to or higher** than your threshold at the end of a scene where [Stress](#stress) increased, make a **[Panic Check](#panic-check)**.
* Traits in Tables A and B can increase or decrease the threshold.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* [Panic Check](#panic-check) rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).
* This threshold does not replace other [Panic Check](#panic-check) triggers (such as a Push).

**Example: [Mental Break](#mental-break) Threshold**
Viper gains **+1 [Stress](#stress)** from witnessing a death, bringing her to **6 [Stress](#stress)**. At the end of the scene she makes a **[Panic Check](#panic-check)** because she is at the threshold.

---

## Trait Notes

**When it applies**
When a trait references Social Fights, Bonded, or Take Aim.

**How it works**
* **Social Fight**: A brief verbal clash. Both participants gain **+1 [Stress](#stress)**. If it happens in a group scene, the Storyteller may apply **-1 Mood** to the room for the scene.
* **Bonded**: A Storyteller-assigned relationship tag (often with an animal). It only matters when another rule calls it out (see [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md)).
* **Take Aim**: Use the **Aim** action from [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md). If you have **Careful Shooter**, Aim grants **+2 [Edge](#edge)** instead of its normal benefit.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* If your table is not tracking Mood, ignore the Mood penalty on Social Fights.

**Example: Social Fight**
Oren (Abrasive) fails a Social check and starts a Social Fight with Marla. Both gain **+1 [Stress](#stress)**, and the room takes **-1 Mood** for the scene.

## Session Advancement

**When it applies**
At the end of each play session.

**How it works**
1. Each [Colonist](#colonist) gains **1 XP**.
2. **1 XP = 1 Skill Point**. Assign XP to a skill you used or trained that session.
3. Apply trait modifiers (Fast Learner, Too Smart, Slow Learner).
4. If the skill has a **Passion**, add **+1 XP** to that skill (once per session).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Minimum XP gained in a session is **0**.
* The **Skill Cap** of **30 Skill Points** still applies.

**Example: Session Advancement**
Viper earns **1 XP** from the session and has **Fast Learner (+1 XP)**. She assigns **2 XP** to **Medical**. Because Medical is also a **Passion**, she adds **+1 XP** for a total of **+3 Skill Points** to Medical, unless it would exceed the **30-point cap**.

---

## Step 5: Other Traits (Neutral/Mixed)

**When it applies**
After rolling Personality traits.

**How it works**
* With Storyteller approval, swap **one** random trait for one trait from this list.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Trait effects that mention [Stress](#stress) or Mental Breaks use [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Neutral/Mixed Traits**
* **Ascetic**: Recover **1 [Stress](#stress)/Day** when eating raw food or sleeping on the ground. **+1 [Bane](#bane)** if using luxury items.
* **Asexual**: No attraction to others.
* **Bisexual**: Attracted to men and women.
* **Bloodlust**: Recover **1 [Stress](#stress)** when you kill an enemy. **2x chance** of starting Social Fights.
* **Careful Shooter**: Action: **Take Aim** (1 AP). Grants **+2 [Edge](#edge)** on next shot (normally +1).
* **Gay**: Attracted to same sex.
* **Night Owl**: Cannot be surprised by night events.
* **Nudist**: **+3 Mood** when naked. **-3 Mood** when wearing clothes.
* **Psychic Sensitive**: Psychic events (Drones/Soothes) have **Double Effect** on you.
* **Psychically Deaf**: Immune to Psychic events.
* **Psychically Dull**: Psychic events have **Half Effect** on you.
* **Undergrounder**: Immune to "Cabin Fever". Recover [Stress](#stress) indoors. -1 Mood/Day if outdoors > 8h.

**Example: Swapping Traits**
Mary rolls **Gourmand** but swaps it for **Night Owl** with Storyteller approval. She keeps the rest of her traits unchanged.

---

## Step 6: Arrival Scenario

**When it applies**
After all Colonists are created. The group chooses one scenario.

**How it works**
Choose one Arrival Scenario and apply its starting Tech Level and gear.

| Scenario | Tech Level | Starting Equipment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crashlanded (Standard)** | Industrial 2 | Bolt-Action Rifle, Revolver, Plasteel Knife, Flak Vest, 30 Packaged Meals, Medkit (x3) |
| **Rich Explorer (Solo Skilled)** | Spacer 1 | Charge Rifle, Glitterworld Medicine (x5), Gold (200), Auto-Turret Blueprint |
| **Lost Tribe (Group Survival)** | Neolithic 4 (Max) | Recurve Bow (x2), Ikwa (x2), Pila (x1), Pemmican (100), Herbal Medicine (x10) |
| **Naked Brutality (Hardcore)** | Neolithic 1 | None (start with 0 Food and bare hands) |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Scenario play guidance appears in [Chapter 8: The Storyteller](chapter_08_storyteller.md).

**Example: Arrival**
The group chooses **Crashlanded**. They note **Industrial 2** tech and take the listed starting gear.


# Chapter 3: Skills & Checks

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, you make a **[Skill Check](#skill-check)** (also called a **[Colonist](#colonist) Roll** in Chapter 1). This chapter explains how checks work and what each skill covers.

---

## [Skill Check](#skill-check)

**When it applies**
When a [Colonist](#colonist) attempts an action with uncertain results and a skill is relevant.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10** (one **[Base Die](#base-die)** and one **[Story Die](#story-die)**).
2. Add the relevant **[Attribute](#attribute)**.
3. Add your **[Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)**.
4. Compare the total to the **[Tier of Success](#tier-of-success)** table.
5. Apply any [Story Die](#story-die) effects (see [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md)).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The [Story Die](#story-die) can trigger a **[Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate)** or **Complication** even if its value is discarded by **[Augmented](#augmented)** or **[Impaired](#impaired)** rolls.
* Skill Modifiers are based on Skill Points (see below).

**Example: [Skill Check](#skill-check)**
Viper attempts a Social check with **Spirit +1** and **Social 25 (+2)**. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 6** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 7**. Total = 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 = **16**, a **Tier 2 (Success)**.

---

## Tiers of Success

**When it applies**
After any [Skill Check](#skill-check).

**How it works**
| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You achieve the goal, but it costs time, resources, or safety. |
| **12-16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve the goal cleanly. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You achieve the goal with extra benefits. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Combat outcomes use the combat rules in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).
* Colony task outputs (Food, CP, RP) are listed in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Tier Result**
Marla rolls a total of **10** on a Construction check. She succeeds with a **Tier 1 (Struggle)** result and finishes the job, but uses extra materials.

---

## Difficulty Without DCs

**When it applies**
When the Storyteller needs to adjust how hard a check is.

**How it works**
1. For easy tasks, grant **[Edge](#edge) (+2)** or allow automatic success.
2. For hard tasks, apply **[Bane](#bane) (-2)** or make the cost of **Tier 1** severe.
3. For extreme tasks, use **Double [Edge](#edge)** or **Double [Bane](#bane)** shifts.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Some subsystems list specific DCs (for example, Term Survival in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)). Use those rules as written.

**Example: Difficulty Without DCs**
A simple lock is old and rusted. The Storyteller rules it opens automatically without a roll. A high-tech vault in combat gets **[Bane](#bane)** and a harsh Tier 1 cost.

---

## Skill Modifiers

**When it applies**
Whenever you add a skill to a check.

**How it works**
Your **Skill Points** (0–30) determine your **[Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)**.

| Skill Points | Modifier |
| :--- | ---: |
| 0–9 | +0 |
| 10–19 | +1 |
| 20–29 | +2 |
| 30 | +3 |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The starting **Skill Cap** is **30** (see [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)).

**Example: [Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)**
Sana has **Animals 22**. Her [Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier) is **+2**.

---

## Modifiers

### [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane)

**When it applies**
When a circumstance gives a minor advantage or disadvantage.

**How it works**
* **[Edge](#edge)** adds **+2** to the roll.
* **[Bane](#bane)** subtracts **-2** from the roll.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Cover, lighting, and positioning are common sources (see [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md)).

**Example: [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane)**
Viper shoots in darkness (**[Bane](#bane)**) but has a laser sight (**[Edge](#edge)**). The modifiers cancel, so she rolls normally.

### Double [Edge](#edge) and Double [Bane](#bane)

**When it applies**
When you have at least two sources of [Edge](#edge) or [Bane](#bane).

**How it works**
* **Double [Edge](#edge)**: Shift your result **up one Tier**.
* **Double [Bane](#bane)**: Shift your result **down one Tier**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The shift happens after you total the roll.

**Example: Double [Edge](#edge)**
Marla rolls **14** on a Shooting check (Tier 2). She has **two** Edges (high ground and target in the open), so the result shifts to **Tier 3**.

### Cancel

**When it applies**
When you have both [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane).

**How it works**
* Cancel one [Edge](#edge) against one [Bane](#bane).
* If one side remains, apply **one** [Edge](#edge) or **one** [Bane](#bane).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* You never apply more than one remaining [Edge](#edge) or [Bane](#bane) after cancellation.

**Example: Cancel**
Oren has **two** Banes (rain and smoke) and **one** [Edge](#edge) (stabilized rifle). One [Bane](#bane) cancels the [Edge](#edge), leaving **one [Bane](#bane)** applied to the roll.

### [Augmented](#augmented) and [Impaired](#impaired)

**When it applies**
When a circumstance grants a major advantage or disadvantage.

**How it works**
* **[Augmented](#augmented)**: Roll **3d10 (keep highest 2)**.
* **[Impaired](#impaired)**: Roll **3d10 (keep lowest 2)**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* [Augmented](#augmented)/[Impaired](#impaired) replace [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane).
* The [Story Die](#story-die) effect still applies even if its value is discarded.

**Example: [Augmented](#augmented)**
Ivo performs surgery with a glitterworld kit. He rolls **3d10**: **[Story Die](#story-die) 1**, **[Base Die](#base-die) 8**, extra die **9**. He keeps **9 + 8 = 17**, then adds **Mind +2** and **Medical 30 (+3)** for a total of **22** (Tier 3). The **[Story Die](#story-die) 1** triggers a [Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate).

**Example: [Impaired](#impaired)**
Sana fires while suppressed (**[Impaired](#impaired)**). She rolls **3d10**: **[Story Die](#story-die) 10**, **[Base Die](#base-die) 4**, extra die **7**. She keeps **4 + 7 = 11**, then adds **Dexterity +2** and **Shooting 20 (+2)** for a total of **15** (Tier 2). The **[Story Die](#story-die) 10** triggers a Complication.

---

## Pushing Your Luck

**When it applies**
When you voluntarily risk [Stress](#stress) to improve a roll.

**How it works**
1. Declare a **Push**.
2. Add **+1 [Stress](#stress)**.
3. Roll **1d6** and add it to your total.
4. If the **d6** shows **1**, trigger a **[Panic Check](#panic-check)** (see [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md)).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The Push happens after the initial roll but before Tiers are applied.

**Example: Push**
Tess rolls **9** on an Intellectual check with **Mind +2** and **Intellectual 10 (+1)** for a total of **12** (Tier 2). She Pushes, gains **+1 [Stress](#stress)**, rolls **1d6 = 3**, and the total becomes **15** (still Tier 2). If the d6 had been a **1**, she would immediately make a [Panic Check](#panic-check) after the action.

---

## Skill List

### Shooting (Dexterity)

**When it applies**
Ranged attacks, turrets, and mortars.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Dexterity + Shooting**. Tier results determine hit quality and damage in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Cover and range bands apply (Chapter 4).

**Example: Shooting**
Viper rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 7** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 4** with **Dexterity +1** and **Shooting 20 (+2)**. Total = 7 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **14** (Tier 2). She deals standard weapon damage.

### Melee (Vigor)

**When it applies**
Hand-to-hand combat with blades or blunt weapons.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Vigor + Melee**. Tier results determine hit quality and damage in Chapter 4.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Entering Melee range is defined in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Melee**
Marla rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 5** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 6** with **Vigor +2** and **Melee 10 (+1)**. Total = 5 + 6 + 2 + 1 = **14** (Tier 2).

### Construction (Vigor)

**When it applies**
Building, repairing, or dismantling structures.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Vigor + Construction**. Convert the Tier to **Construction Points (CP)** in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Some Facilities require specific Tech Levels (Chapter 6).

**Example: Construction**
Marla rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 8** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 3** with **Vigor +2** and **Construction 20 (+2)**. Total = 8 + 3 + 2 + 2 = **15** (Tier 2), yielding **5 CP**.

### Mining (Vigor)

**When it applies**
Digging, extracting ore, and smoothing stone.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Vigor + Mining**. Convert the Tier to resource yields in Chapter 6.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Certain biomes grant Mining modifiers (see [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md)).

**Example: Mining**
Oren rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 6** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 2** with **Vigor +1** and **Mining 10 (+1)**. Total = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **10** (Tier 1), yielding **1 Ore**.

### Cooking (Dexterity)

**When it applies**
Preparing meals, butchering, and processing food.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Dexterity + Cooking**. Use the Cooking conversion outputs in Chapter 6.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Food poisoning risks are handled in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Cooking**
Ivo rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 7** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 5** with **Dexterity -1** and **Cooking 20 (+2)**. Total = 7 + 5 - 1 + 2 = **13** (Tier 2), converting **2 Food** into **3 Meals**.

### Plants (Mind)

**When it applies**
Sowing, harvesting, foraging, and cutting trees.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Mind + Plants**. Use the yield table in Chapter 6.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Biome modifiers can apply (Chapter 7).

**Example: Plants**
Sana rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 9** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 4** with **Mind +0** and **Plants 20 (+2)**. Total = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = **15** (Tier 2).

### Animals (Spirit)

**When it applies**
Taming, training, and handling animals.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Spirit + Animals**. The Storyteller applies the Tier to the animal’s response.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Failed checks against predators can trigger a Manhunter reaction (Chapter 4).

**Example: Animals**
Tess rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 5** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 2** with **Spirit +0** and **Animals 10 (+1)**. Total = 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 = **8** (Tier 1). The muffalo resists and wanders off.

### Crafting (Dexterity)

**When it applies**
Smithing, tailoring, machining, and assembly work.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Dexterity + Crafting**. The result determines **Item Quality** in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Crafting Points (CP) are earned through colony work in Chapter 6.

**Example: Crafting**
Oren rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 8** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 8** with **Dexterity +1** and **Crafting 30 (+3)**. Total = 8 + 8 + 1 + 3 = **20** (Tier 3), producing **Masterwork** quality.

### Artistic (Spirit)

**When it applies**
Creating sculptures, music, or morale-boosting art.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Spirit + Artistic**. The Tier sets the art’s quality and Mood impact.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Mood effects are handled in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Artistic**
Marla rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 6** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 6** with **Spirit -1** and **Artistic 20 (+2)**. Total = 6 + 6 - 1 + 2 = **13** (Tier 2). The art grants a modest Mood bonus.

### Medical (Mind)

**When it applies**
Tending wounds, surgery, and disease treatment.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Mind + Medical**. Apply healing effects and risks per Chapter 4.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Medicine items are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Medical**
Ivo rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 6** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 6** with **Mind +2** and **Medical 30 (+3)**. Total = 6 + 6 + 2 + 3 = **17** (Tier 3). The patient stabilizes quickly.

### Social (Spirit)

**When it applies**
Trading, recruiting, peace talks, and calming others.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Spirit + Social**. Apply effects using the relevant subsystem (trade in Chapter 5, recruitment in Chapter 6, factions in Chapter 7).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Some Social outcomes depend on Goodwill (Chapter 7).

**Example: Social**
Viper rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 7** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 5** with **Spirit +1** and **Social 20 (+2)**. Total = 7 + 5 + 1 + 2 = **15** (Tier 2). The trader agrees to a fair price.

### Intellectual (Mind)

**When it applies**
Research, scanning, and solving technical problems.

**How it works**
Make a [Skill Check](#skill-check) using **Mind + Intellectual**. Apply research progress in Chapter 6.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Long tasks like Research require cumulative progress (Chapter 6).

**Example: Intellectual**
Tess rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 9** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 3** with **Mind +2** and **Intellectual 20 (+2)**. Total = 9 + 3 + 2 + 2 = **16** (Tier 2), granting **50 RP**.


# Chapter 4: Survival & Combat

Life on the Rim is a constant struggle against hunger, madness, and violent death. This chapter covers the rules for keeping your colonists alive—both physically and mentally.

---

## Part 1: Survival & Needs

### Core Needs

**When it applies**
All day, every day.

**How it works**
Use the requirements below. If a requirement is not met, apply the listed penalty.

| Need | Requirement | Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food** | 2 Meals per day | **+1 [Stress](#stress)** per missed meal. After 3 days, take **1d10 Damage** per day (Starvation). |
| **Rest** | 8 hours of sleep | **+1 [Stress](#stress)** per night of poor/missed sleep. Become **Fatigued (-2 to all rolls)**. |
| **Recreation** | 4 hours of leisure time | **+1 [Stress](#stress)** if ignored for 2+ days. |
| **Beauty** | Clean rooms, art, paved floors | **+1 [Stress](#stress)** if spending 4+ hours in an "Ugly" space. |
| **Comfort** | Chairs, beds, temperature control | **+1 [Stress](#stress)** after sleeping on the ground or in extreme heat/cold. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Two or more Colonists working on the same activity in the same period count as **Socializing** for Recreation.
* Traits can modify Rest or Comfort (see [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)).
* Colony schedules and periods are defined in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Core Needs**
Viper misses **one meal** (+1 [Stress](#stress)) and sleeps in the cold (+1 [Stress](#stress)). She gains **2 [Stress](#stress)** by morning.

---

### Gaining [Stress](#stress)

**When it applies**
Whenever a [Colonist](#colonist) experiences strain, danger, or deprivation.

**How it works**
Gain [Stress](#stress) from the triggers below.

| Trigger | [Stress](#stress) |
| :--- | ---: |
| Unmet Need | See Core Needs table |
| Pushing a Roll | +1 [Stress](#stress) |
| Witnessing Death (Stranger/Enemy) | +1 [Stress](#stress) |
| Witnessing Death ([Colonist](#colonist)/Bonded Animal) | +3 [Stress](#stress) |
| Untended Wounds or Painful Scars (per day) | +1 [Stress](#stress) |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* "Bonded" is a Storyteller-assigned relationship tag (see [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)).

**Example: Gaining [Stress](#stress)**
Marla pushes a roll (+1 [Stress](#stress)) and then watches a bonded muffalo die (+3 [Stress](#stress)). She gains **4 [Stress](#stress)** in that scene.

---

### [Stress](#stress) Die

**When it applies**
When a rule tells you to roll a **[Stress](#stress) Die**.

**How it works**
* Roll **1d6** and add it to your total.
* If **any [Stress](#stress) Die** shows **1**, trigger a **[Panic Check](#panic-check)**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* The **Push** adds a [Stress](#stress) Die (see [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md)).

**Example: [Stress](#stress) Die**
Oren rolls a [Stress](#stress) Die and gets a **1**. He adds the **1** to his total, then immediately makes a **[Panic Check](#panic-check)** after the action.

---

### [Panic Check](#panic-check) ([Mental Break](#mental-break))

**When it applies**
When a rule triggers a [Panic Check](#panic-check) ([Stress](#stress) Die result of 1, a Push, certain traits, or a [Mental Break](#mental-break) Threshold trigger).

**How it works**
1. Roll **1d6 + Current [Stress](#stress)**.
2. Apply the result from the table below.

| Result | Break Type | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1–6** | **Anxious** | **Trembling**: -2 to all Dexterity/Shooting rolls for 1 hour. |
| **7–9** | **Minor Break** | **Binge**: Consume 3x Meals or Drugs immediately. |
| **10–12** | **Major Break** | **Tantrum**: Attack a random colony structure/item (it loses 10 CP). |
| **13+** | **Extreme Break** | **Insulting Spree**: Verbally abuse allies. Each ally gains **+1 [Stress](#stress)**. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* [Mental Break](#mental-break) Threshold rules are in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**Example: [Panic Check](#panic-check)**
Tess has **5 [Stress](#stress)** and rolls a **4** on the d6. Total = **9**, so she suffers a **Minor Break** and goes on a Binge.

---

### Relieving [Stress](#stress)

**When it applies**
After crises, during downtime, or through special actions.

**How it works**
Reduce [Stress](#stress) using the options below.

| Method | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Luxury Meal** | Remove **2 [Stress](#stress)**. |
| **Relaxing Socially** | On a **Tier 2** Social check, remove **1 [Stress](#stress)**. |
| **Catharsis** | Completing a [Mental Break](#mental-break) resets [Stress](#stress) to **0**. |
| **Sleep (Excellent+ Bed)** | A full night’s sleep removes **all [Stress](#stress)**. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Meal types and bed quality are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md) and [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Relieving [Stress](#stress)**
Viper has **5 [Stress](#stress)**. She eats a **Luxury Meal** (down to **3**), then sleeps in an **Excellent** bed and returns to **0**.

---

## Part 2: Combat

### Initiative

**When it applies**
At the start of combat.

**How it works**
1. The players make a **group roll** of **1d10**.
2. On **6–10**, players act first.
3. On **1–5**, enemies act first.

**Example: Initiative**
The group rolls a **7** on the Initiative check. Players act first.

---

### Turns and Rounds

**When it applies**
After Initiative.

**How it works**
1. The two sides alternate turns (Players → Enemies → Players).
2. A **Round** ends when all combatants have acted once.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* If one side has no combatants left, the encounter ends.

**Example: Turns and Rounds**
Players act, then enemies act. When both sides have taken a turn, the round ends and a new round begins.

---

### [Action Points (AP)](#action-points-ap)

**When it applies**
On a [Colonist](#colonist)’s turn.

**How it works**
Each [Colonist](#colonist) has **4 AP** per turn to spend on actions.

| Action | AP | Effect |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Move** | 1 | Shift **one [Range Band](#range-band)** closer or farther. |
| **Rush** | 2 | Shift **two Range Bands**. |
| **Attack** | 2 | Make a Shooting or Melee attack. |
| **Aim** | 1 | Gain **[Augmented](#augmented)** on your next attack. |
| **Take Cover** | 1 | Attacks against you take **[Bane](#bane)**. |
| **Aid** | 1 | Grant **[Edge](#edge)** to an ally’s next roll. |
| **Use Item** | 1 | Reload, switch weapon, or use a consumable. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Range Bands are defined in [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md).

**Example: Spending AP**
Marla spends **1 AP** to Move to Close range, **1 AP** to Take Cover, and **2 AP** to Attack.

---

### Attack Resolution

**When it applies**
When you take the Attack action.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10 + [Attribute](#attribute) + [Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)**.
2. Attacks always hit; the Tier determines damage.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Weak Hit** | Deal **Half Damage**. |
| **12–16** | **Tier 2: Solid Hit** | Deal **Full Damage**. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Critical Hit** | Deal **Double Damage** and roll **Major Injury**. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Weapon stats are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Attack Roll**
Viper shoots with **Dexterity +1** and **Shooting 20 (+2)**. She rolls **[Base Die](#base-die) 8** and **[Story Die](#story-die) 6**. Total = 8 + 6 + 1 + 2 = **17**, a **Tier 3 Critical Hit**.

---

### Damage and Armor

**When it applies**
After an attack hit is resolved.

**How it works**
1. Calculate **Damage = (Weapon Damage × Tier Multiplier) - Armor Rating**.
2. Apply the remaining damage to HP.
3. **HP** = \`15 + (Vigor × 2)\`.
4. At **0 HP**, a character is **Downed** and begins bleeding out for **Vigor hours (minimum 1 hour)** unless tended.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Armor values are listed in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Damage and Armor**
A rifle does **6 Damage**. Viper hits at **Tier 3**, so damage is **12**. The raider has **Armor 3**, so final damage is **9**.

---

### Critical Effects and Conditions

**When it applies**
When an attack results in a **Tier 3 Critical Hit**.

**How it works**
1. If the target has Cover, reduce it one step (**Heavy → Light → None**).
2. Apply any weapon or effect conditions.

| Condition | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stunned** | Lose your next Action Turn (0 AP). |
| **Slowed** | Movement costs **+1 AP**. |
| **Paralyzed** | Cannot Move or Act. Defense is 0 (Auto-Crit). |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Some weapons apply additional conditions (see Chapter 5).

**Example: Critical Condition**
Sana lands a **Tier 3** hit on a raider behind **Heavy Cover**. The cover drops to **Light Cover**, and the raider is **Stunned**.

---

### Major Injuries

**When it applies**
After a **Tier 3 Critical Hit** or specific traps and events.

**How it works**
Roll **1d10** and apply the result.

| d10 | Injury | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1–3** | **Bleeding** | Take **1 Damage/turn** until tended. |
| **4** | **Stunned** | Lose your next Action Turn (0 AP). |
| **5** | **Slowed** | Movement costs **+1 AP** for 1 hour. |
| **6** | **Concussion** | **[Impaired](#impaired)** on mental actions. Skills disabled. |
| **7** | **Organ Damage (Lung)** | **-2 [Bane](#bane)** on Movement/Vigor checks (Breathing). |
| **8** | **Organ Damage (Heart)** | Bleed-out time reduced by half. |
| **9** | **Eye/Ear Loss** | Permanent **-2 [Bane](#bane)** on Perception/Shooting. |
| **10** | **Severed Part** | Lose a limb. Roll **1d4**: (1) Hand, (2) Arm, (3) Leg, (4) Head (Instant death). |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Prosthetics and bionics are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Major Injury**
Marla rolls a **7** on the Major Injury table. She suffers **Organ Damage (Lung)** and takes **-2 [Bane](#bane)** on Movement/Vigor checks.

---

### Body Part Banes (Permanent)

**When it applies**
When a character loses a body part.

**How it works**
Apply the relevant penalty until replaced.

| Lost Part | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Hand** | **+1 [Bane](#bane)** to fine motor skills (Shooting, Crafting, Medical). Cannot dual-wield. |
| **Missing Arm** | **+2 [Bane](#bane)** to fine motor skills. Cannot use two-handed items. |
| **Missing Foot** | Movement actions cost **+1 AP**. |
| **Missing Leg** | Cannot take Movement actions (must crawl or be carried). |
| **Missing Eye** | **+1 [Bane](#bane)** to Shooting and Perception. |
| **Missing Ear** | **+1 [Bane](#bane)** to Social and Awareness. |
| **Organ Damage** | See Major Injury table. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Replacement limbs cancel penalties as described in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Body Part Banes**
After losing her left arm, Viper suffers **+2 [Bane](#bane)** on Medical checks and cannot use her two-handed rifle.

---

### Death and Downed

**When it applies**
When a character reaches **0 HP**.

**How it works**
* At **0 HP**, the character is **Downed** and unconscious.
* If they take damage while Downed, they **die**.
* If they are not tended before their bleed-out time expires, they **die**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Tending rules are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md) and [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Death and Downed**
A [Colonist](#colonist) drops to **0 HP** and is Downed. A raider attacks them again, dealing damage. The [Colonist](#colonist) **dies** immediately.

---

## Part 3: Expeditions (Caravans)

### Travel Speed

**When it applies**
When traveling across the world map.

**How it works**
* **Base Speed**: 1 Hex per day.
* **Modifiers**: +1 for mounts, +1 on roads, -1 in difficult terrain or winter.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Hex scale is defined in [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md).

**Example: Travel Speed**
A caravan with mounts on roads moves **3 Hexes** in **1 day** (base 1 + mounts 1 + roads 1).

---

### Foraging and Rations

**When it applies**
Each day of travel.

**How it works**
1. Each [Colonist](#colonist) consumes **2 Meals**.
2. If you have no rations, make a **Plants** check vs **DC 12**.
3. On Success, find enough wild food.
4. On **Tier 1 (Struggle)**, everyone gains **+1 [Stress](#stress)** and **Starvation** begins.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* This subsystem uses a DC as written, even though most checks use Tiers.

**Example: Foraging**
The caravan is out of rations. Tess rolls **2d10 + Mind + Plants** and totals **10** (Tier 1). Everyone gains **+1 [Stress](#stress)** and Starvation starts.

---

### Ambushes

**When it applies**
For every **3 Hexes** traveled.

**How it works**
1. The Storyteller rolls for an event.
2. Players may roll **Intellectual** (Scanning) or **Animals** (Scouting).
3. On Success, they spot the ambush and choose distance or evade.
4. On **Tier 1 (Struggle)**, they are ambushed. Enemies start with Initiative and Cover.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Enemy stats are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Ambush**
After 3 Hexes, Sana rolls **Animals** and totals **13** (Tier 2). The group spots raiders early and chooses **Medium** range.

---

### Carrying Capacity

**When it applies**
When transporting heavy goods.

**How it works**
* Colonists can carry personal gear.
* **Pack Animals** (Muffalo, Alpaca) are required for heavy trade goods.
* **Overburdened** caravans move at **0.5 Hexes/day**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Pack animal stats are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Carrying Capacity**
The caravan loads too much steel and becomes **Overburdened**. Their speed drops to **0.5 Hexes/day**.


# Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy

Survival on the Rim requires the right tools. A sharp knife, a warm parka, and a pocket full of silver can make the difference between life and death.

---

## Economy

### Currency and Starting Wealth

**When it applies**
When the campaign begins or when trading.

**How it works**
* The universal currency of the Rim is **Silver**.
* Starting wealth and gear are determined by your Arrival Scenario in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Some scenarios start with gear instead of Silver.

**Example: Starting Wealth**
A Crashlanded group starts with listed gear instead of a pile of Silver, then begins trading as soon as a caravan arrives.

---

### Market Value

**When it applies**
When determining the base value of an item.

**How it works**
Use the formula below.

**Market Value = Material Cost + (Crafting Points × 0.5)**

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* If an item has no material cost, treat it as **0**.
* Crafting Points (CP) are generated in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Market Value**
A weapon costs **60 Steel** and **100 CP**. Market Value = 60 + (100 × 0.5) = **110 Silver**.

---

### Trading Prices

**When it applies**
When buying or selling items with a trader.

**How it works**
1. Start with Market Value.
2. Apply base prices.
3. Apply the Social Bonus.

| Price Type | Base Rate |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Buy** | 140% of Market Value |
| **Sell** | 60% of Market Value |

**Social Bonus**
* Improve prices by **2% per Social Skill Point**, up to **±40%**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Use the Social skill rules in [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).
* The maximum bonus is reached at **Social 20**.

**Example: Trading**

**How it works**
Add points for each constructed facility.

| Facility | Points |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Barracks** | 2 |
| **Private Bedroom** | 3 |
| **Kitchen** | 4 |
| **Workshop** | 6 |
| **Hospital** | 8 |
| **Rec Room** | 5 |
| **Research Lab** | 8 |
| **Wood Generator** | 10 |
| **Solar Panel** | 12 |
| **Battery** | 8 |

**Power Bonus**: +2 points per powered facility.

**Example: Building Points**
A colony with **1 Kitchen (4)**, **1 Workshop (6)**, and **1 Solar Panel (12)** has **22 Building Points**, plus power bonuses for powered facilities.

---

### Defense Points

**When it applies**
When calculating Wealth Score.

**How it works**
Sum points from defensive structures.

| Structure | Points |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Wall Section (Wood)** | 0.5 |
| **Wall Section (Stone)** | 1 |
| **Sandbags** | 0.5 |
| **Mini Turret** | 5 |
| **Mortar** | 6 |

**Example: Defense Points**
Ten stone walls (10 points) and two turrets (10 points) total **20 Defense Points**.

---

### [Colonist](#colonist) Points

**When it applies**
When calculating Wealth Score.

**How it works**
Use the table below.

| Type | Points |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Player Character** | 10 |
| **Recruit** | 5 |

**Example: [Colonist](#colonist) Points**
Three PCs and two Recruits = (3 × 10) + (2 × 5) = **40 points**.

---

### Colony Tiers and Recruit Limit

**When it applies**
After calculating Wealth Score.

**How it works**
Use the table below to find your tier and Recruit limit.

| Wealth Score | Colony Tier | Max Recruits |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| **0–9** | Struggling | 0 |
| **10–24** | Stable | 1 |
| **25–49** | Established | 2 |
| **50–99** | Prosperous | 3 |
| **100+** | Powerhouse | 4 |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* If Wealth drops below your tier, the Storyteller decides which Recruits leave or turn hostile.
* Player Characters do not count against the Recruit limit.

**Example: Colony Tier**
A colony with **Wealth Score 57** is **Prosperous** and may keep **3 Recruits**.

---

### The Colony as Home Base

**When it applies**
During campaign downtime and long-term projects.

**How it works**
* The colony base is the main map where buildings and stockpiles are located.
* Most Recruits stay at the colony base while PCs travel.

**Example: Home Base**
The PCs leave on a caravan. Recruits stay behind to farm, craft, and defend the base.

---

### Recruit Roles

**When it applies**
When assigning a new Recruit’s role.

**How it works**
* **Specialist**: Crafter/Worker.
* **Retainer**: Guard/Hunter.
* **Sage**: Researcher/Advisor.
* Roles determine starting stats and skills but do not limit actions.

**Example: Recruit Role**
A new [Colonist](#colonist) with Medical skills is assigned **Sage** to boost research and healing.

---

### Creating a Recruit

**When it applies**
When a new recruit joins during play.

**How it works**
1. **Pick a Role** (Specialist, Retainer, Sage).
2. **Assign Attributes** using **+2, +1, 0, -1**.
3. **Assign Skills**: one primary at **30 (+3)**, one secondary at **20 (+2)**, optional minors at **10 (+1)**.
4. **Traits and Hooks**: Give 1–2 traits and a story hook.
5. **Loyalty**: Set Loyalty from **0–5**.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Traits are listed in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**Example: Creating a Recruit**
A **Specialist** gets **Construction 30 (+3)** and **Crafting 20 (+2)**, then a trait like **Industrious**, and starts at **Loyalty 2**.

---

### Role Details

#### Specialist (Crafter / Worker)

**How it works**
* Primary Skill **30 (+3)** in Construction, Crafting, Plants, Cooking, or Mining.
* Secondary Skill **20 (+2)** in a supporting skill.
* While at the colony base, a Specialist can handle routine tasks in their specialty at **Tier 2** without a roll if conditions are normal.
* Once per day, a Specialist can grant **[Edge](#edge)** on a related check made by a player character.

**Example: Specialist**
A Specialist with **Construction 30** completes a routine wall repair at **Tier 2** without a roll, and later grants **[Edge](#edge)** to a PC building a turret.

#### Retainer (Guard / Hunter)

**How it works**
* Primary Skill **30 (+3)** in **Shooting** or **Melee**.
* Secondary Skill **20 (+2)** in the other combat skill, **Animals**, or **Medical**.
* Once per round, if in position, a Retainer can **Assist** a PC attack, granting **[Edge](#edge)** or canceling **[Bane](#bane)**.
* When defending the colony base, the Storyteller can treat one minor skirmish per day as handled off-screen.

**Example: Retainer**
During a raid, the Retainer grants **[Edge](#edge)** to Viper’s shot once this round, helping her score a Tier 3 hit.

#### Sage (Researcher / Advisor)

**How it works**
* Primary Skill **30 (+3)** in **Intellectual**.
* Secondary Skill **20 (+2)** in **Medical**, **Social**, or another fitting skill.
* Add **+1 RP per day** to a Research project while at the colony base.
* Once per session, grant **Double [Edge](#edge)** on a check that uses their expertise.

**Example: Sage**
A Sage adds **+1 RP** to Gunsmithing each day and grants **Double [Edge](#edge)** to a planning check before a raid.

---

### Recruitment Checks

**When it applies**
When a potential Recruit appears.

**How it works**
1. The [Colonist](#colonist) with the highest **Social** rolls \`2d10 + Spirit + Social\`.
2. Use the suggested DCs.
3. Apply Tier results.

Suggested difficulty:
* **DC 13** for a neutral stranger.
* **DC 15+** for someone hostile or unwilling.

Tier results:
* **Tier 1 (11-)**: They refuse, or join at **Loyalty 1** with a Complication.
* **Tier 2 (12–16)**: They join at **Loyalty 2–3** with no major complications.
* **Tier 3 (17+)**: They join at **Loyalty 4** and bring a bonus.

[Story Die](#story-die) effects:
* **[Story Die](#story-die) 1 (Twist)**: Unexpected connection or positive reveal.
* **[Story Die](#story-die) 10 (Complication)**: Someone is unhappy about the deal.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Recruitment scenes are often tied to events in [Chapter 8: The Storyteller](chapter_08_storyteller.md).

**Example: Recruitment Check**
Mary rolls **2d10 + Spirit + Social** and totals **16**. The recruit joins at **Loyalty 3** with no major complications.

---

### Loyalty in Play

**When it applies**
When Recruits are treated well or poorly.

**How it works**
Increase Loyalty by **+1** when:
* You save a Recruit from serious danger.
* You give them good gear, a private room, or meaningful recognition.
* You support them in disputes or respect their beliefs.

Decrease Loyalty by **-1** when:
* You repeatedly send them on dangerous tasks without support.
* You neglect their Needs for long periods.
* You treat them as expendable.

If Loyalty hits **0**, they suffer a **Loyalty Break**:
* Leave in the night.
* Sabotage and flee.
* Lash out at a [Colonist](#colonist).
* Join an enemy faction.

At **Loyalty 5**:
* Promote them to a full player character, or
* Treat them as a major story figure.

**Example: Loyalty**
A Recruit rescued from a raid gains **+1 Loyalty**. Later, after being denied food for days, they lose **-1 Loyalty**.

---

### Wealth, Events, and New Recruits

**When it applies**
When the colony crosses into a new tier with open Recruit slots.

**How it works**
The Storyteller can introduce **New Arrival** events:
* Refugees fleeing raids.
* Wandering specialists seeking safe homes.
* Mercenaries or nobles searching for work.

High Wealth Score also attracts dangerous arrivals:
* Criminals, spies, or raiders posing as harmless.

**Example: New Arrival**
After reaching **Prosperous** tier, a refugee Medic arrives and asks to join.

# Chapter 8: The Storyteller (GM Section)

Welcome, Storyteller. You are the architect of chaos, the hand of fate, and the voice of the Rim itself. This chapter provides tools to run engaging, challenging, and memorable RimWorld RPG sessions.

---

## Part 1: Running the Game

### Your Role as Storyteller

**When it applies**
All sessions.

**How it works**
* **Create Drama**: Introduce threats, opportunities, and moral dilemmas.
* **Be Fair**: Don’t fudge dice to kill characters, but don’t pull punches either.
* **Embrace Chaos**: Let player choices and the [Story Die](#story-die) drive the narrative.

**Example: Storyteller Role**
A raid starts small, but a **[Story Die](#story-die) 10** complication adds a second wave and forces a hard choice.

---

### Pacing and Tone

**When it applies**
When planning session structure.

**How it works**
* **Colony Phase** (Downtime): Assign tasks, roleplay, plan. **3–7 in-game days per session**.

**How it works**
Roll the **[Story Die](#story-die) (1d10)**:
* **1 ([Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate))**: Event has a silver lining (bonus loot, early warning).
* **10 (Complication)**: Event is worse than expected (more enemies, longer duration).

**Example: [Story Die](#story-die)**
A raid triggers and the [Story Die](#story-die) shows **1**. The raiders arrive late, giving the colony time to prepare.

---

## Part 5: Quests

### Quest Types

**When it applies**
When the Storyteller offers a quest.

**How it works**
Choose a quest type and run the listed challenge and reward.

**Example: Quest Frequency**
After declining two requests, the faction reduces Goodwill by **-10**.

---

## Part 6: Wealth Score Management

### Calculating Wealth Score

**When it applies**
When scaling threats.

**How it works**
**Wealth Score = Tech Points + Building Points + Defense Points + [Colonist](#colonist) Points**

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Point values are defined in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Wealth Score**
The colony’s points total **50**, so raid points are **50**.

### Threat Points System

**When it applies**
When building raids from a budget.

**How it works**
1. **Wealth Score = Raid Points**.
2. Spend Raid Points to buy enemies.

| Wealth Score | Raid Points | Example Raid (Tribal) | Example Raid (Mech) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **15 (Start)** | **15 pts** | 3 Warriors (5 pts ea) | 1 Lancer (15 pts) |
| **30 (Early)** | **30 pts** | 6 Warriors | 1 Scyther, 1 Lancer |
| **50 (Mid)** | **50 pts** | 10 Warriors | 2 Scythers, 1 Lancer |
| **100 (Late)** | **100 pts** | 20 Warriors | 1 Centipede, 2 Scythers |

**Enemy Costs (Approx)**
* **Tribal Warrior**: 5 pts
* **Pirate Gunner**: 10 pts
* **Elite Mercenary**: 25 pts
* **Warg / Wolf**: 10 pts
* **Lancer**: 15 pts
* **Scyther**: 20 pts
* **Centipede**: 60 pts

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Enemy stat blocks are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Threat Points**
A 50-point raid could be **10 Tribal Warriors** or **2 Scythers + 1 Lancer**.

---

### Balancing Tips

**When it applies**
When tuning difficulty.

**How it works**
* Don’t punish success; use scaling to challenge, not crush.
* Reward preparation (defenses should matter).
* Vary threat types beyond raids.

**Example: Balance**
If players are struggling, reduce event frequency or offer a relief quest.

---

## Part 7: Final Advice

### Embrace Failure

**When it applies**
When players fail or lose characters.

**How it works**
Let consequences stand, but provide recovery opportunities.

**Example: Failure**
A [Colonist](#colonist) dies in a raid. The next week, a refugee Medic arrives as a possible recruit.

---

### Let Players Drive

**When it applies**
When players choose unexpected goals.

**How it works**
Support player-driven objectives and adjust events to match.

**Example: Player Drive**
If players focus on trade, introduce caravans and trade quests instead of constant raids.

---

### Use the [Story Die](#story-die)

**When it applies**
During key events.

**How it works**
Let a **[Story Die](#story-die) 1** create opportunity and a **[Story Die](#story-die) 10** create pressure.

**Example: [Story Die](#story-die) Use**
A [Story Die](#story-die) **10** during a raid means the raiders brought a doomsday launcher.

---

### Have Fun

**When it applies**
Always.

**How it works**
Keep the pace sharp, the stakes clear, and the choices meaningful.

**Example: Have Fun**
End the session on a cliffhanger and ask players what they want to tackle next.


# Chapter 9: Quickstart One-Shot

> **Note**: This quickstart uses simplified mechanics for one-session play. See Chapters 1–8 for full rules.

---

## Quickstart Overview

**Premise**
Your shuttle breaks apart over a frozen-forest Rimworld. You crash near **Greyhook Ridge** with almost nothing. The first day decides everything: get shelter, food, and a basic defense before nightfall.

**One-Sentence Goal**
Survive the first night and secure a defensible foothold.

**Session Details**
* **Session length**: 2.5–4 hours
* **Players**: 3–5 plus Storyteller
* **Tone**: Survival drama, sudden violence, messy heroics

**Core Systems Used (Quickstart)**
* [Story Die](#story-die) (Twist / Complication)
* Tiers (Struggle / Success / Triumph)
* [Edge](#edge)/[Bane](#bane) (Quickstart variant)
* Needs, Mood, [Stress](#stress) (light)
* Combat (AP and cover)
* Equipment and Market Value (light)
* Colony Day Loop (4 periods)
* Research and Build/Harvest/Hunt (light)

---

## Quickstart Rules (Simplified)

### Dice and Tiers

**When it applies**
Whenever a [Colonist](#colonist) attempts an action with an uncertain outcome.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10** (one [Base Die](#base-die), one **red [Story Die](#story-die)**).
2. Add the relevant **[Attribute](#attribute)** and **[Skill Modifier](#skill-modifier)**.
3. Compare the total to the Tier table.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Struggle** | You succeed with a major cost. |
| **12–16** | **Success** | You succeed cleanly. |
| **17+** | **Triumph** | You succeed with extra benefits. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Full rules are in [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md) and [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).

**Example: Dice and Tiers**
Sana rolls **2d10 + Dexterity + Shooting** and totals **15**. That is a **Success**.

---

### [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane) (Quickstart Variant)

**When it applies**
When a circumstance gives a small advantage or disadvantage.

**How it works**
* **[Edge](#edge)**: Reroll **either die once** and keep the new result.
* **[Bane](#bane)**: The Storyteller rerolls **one die that looks too good**, and you must keep the new result.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* This quickstart version is different from the full rules (see Chapter 1).

**Example: [Edge](#edge) and [Bane](#bane)**
Viper has [Edge](#edge) for high ground. She rerolls her **[Base Die](#base-die) 3** and gets a **7**, improving her total.

---

### [Story Die](#story-die) Triggers

**When it applies**
After any roll that includes the red [Story Die](#story-die).

**How it works**
* **[Story Die](#story-die) 1**: **[Twist of Fate](#twist-of-fate)** (Inspiration, [Edge](#edge), or a boon).
* **[Story Die](#story-die) 10**: **Complication** ([Bane](#bane), [Stress](#stress), or a new danger).

**Example: [Story Die](#story-die)**
Oren rolls a **10** on the [Story Die](#story-die). He succeeds, but the Storyteller introduces a Complication.

---

### Action Points and Range Bands

**When it applies**
During combat.

**How it works**
* Each [Colonist](#colonist) has **4 AP** per turn.
* Range Bands are **Melee, Close, Medium, Far**.

| Action | AP | Effect |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Move** | 1 | Shift one band. |
| **Attack** | 2 | Make a ranged or melee attack. |
| **Take Cover** | 1 | Gain defensive [Edge](#edge). |
| **Use Item** | 1 | Reload, switch, or heal. |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Full combat rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Action Points**
Marla spends **1 AP** to Move to Close range, **1 AP** to Take Cover, and **2 AP** to Attack.

---

### Combat Damage

**When it applies**
After a successful attack roll.

**How it works**
* **Struggle**: Half damage
* **Success**: Full damage
* **Triumph**: Double damage and roll Major Injury

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Weapon stats are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Combat Damage**
A rifle deals **6 damage**. On a **Triumph**, it deals **12 damage** before armor.

---

### HP

**When it applies**
When tracking damage.

**How it works**
* **HP = 15 + (Vigor × 2)**.
* At **0 HP**, the [Colonist](#colonist) is **Downed** and bleeding out.

**Example: HP**
A [Colonist](#colonist) with **Vigor +1** has **17 HP**.

---

---

## Day Loop (4 Periods)

### Periods and Actions

**When it applies**
Each in-game day.

**How it works**
* **Dawn, Midday, Dusk, Night**.
* Each [Colonist](#colonist) chooses **one major action per period**.

**Common Actions**
* Build Shelter (Construction)
* Gather Resources (Mining or Plants)
* Hunt (Shooting or Animals)
* Cook (Cooking)
* Treat Wounds (Medicine)
* Research Basics (Intellectual)
* Scout (Dexterity + Plants/Animals)

At Dawn, Marla builds, Sana hunts, and Ivo treats wounds. At Night, everyone sleeps.

---

### Needs, Mood, and [Stress](#stress) (Light)

**When it applies**
At the end of each period.

**How it works**
* If a Need is neglected, apply **-1 Mood**.
* If **two or more** Needs are neglected, apply **+1 [Stress](#stress)**.

**Example: Needs and Mood**

---

### [Mental Break](#mental-break) Trigger (Quickstart)

**When it applies**
When [Stress](#stress) accumulates quickly.

**How it works**
Trigger a [Mental Break](#mental-break) if a [Colonist](#colonist) reaches **3 [Stress](#stress)** and rolls a **Complication ([Story Die](#story-die) 10)**.

**Quick [Mental Break](#mental-break) Table (1d6)**
| d6 | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1–2** | Wander / Shut Down |
| **3–4** | Food Binge |
| **5** | Berserk |
| **6** | Sadistic / Destructive Outburst |

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Full [Mental Break](#mental-break) rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: [Mental Break](#mental-break)**
Tess reaches **3 [Stress](#stress)** and rolls a **[Story Die](#story-die) 10** during a fight. She rolls **1d6 = 5** and goes **Berserk**.

---

## The Crash Site

### The Map
![The Crash Site](../images/TheCrashSite.png)
A shallow valley beside **Greyhook Ridge** with a treeline to the west, a rock outcrop to the north, and a ruined shack to the east.

---

### Starting Supplies

* 6 simple rations
* 1 bedroll per [Colonist](#colonist)
* Scrap metal (enough for 1 barricade or 1 simple room)
* 1 basic tool kit
* 1 ranged weapon total for the team plus knives

---

### The First Choice (Dawn)

**When it applies**
The first scene of the session.

**How it works**
The group chooses **Repair the Ruin** or **Build a New Lean-To** near the rocks, then makes a **group check** using **Construction** or **Survival**.

Group check (quickstart):
* Everyone rolls.
* Take the **best Tier** rolled and apply that outcome.

Outcomes:
* **Struggle**: Shelter is weak. Night defense is harder.
* **Success**: Decent shelter.
* **Triumph**: Shelter plus a basic barricade.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* If your table does not use **Survival**, substitute the most relevant skill (usually **Plants** or **Animals**).

**Example: Group Check**
Marla rolls a **Success** and Sana rolls a **Struggle**. The best Tier is **Success**, so the shelter is decent.

---

## Scripted Events (Use 2 of 3)

### Event A - The Injured Wanderer (Midday)

**When it applies**
Midday, after the first major action.

**How it works**
A bleeding survivor arrives with **medicine and a pistol**. The group must decide to help, rob, or refuse.

**Twist ([Story Die](#story-die) 1)**: They reveal a cache location.
**Complication ([Story Die](#story-die) 10)**: They are being tracked.

**Example: Event A**
The group helps the wanderer, gaining medicine and a future recruit lead.

---

### Event B - The Trader with Bad Timing (Dusk)

**When it applies**
Dusk, before final preparations.

**How it works**
A small caravan offers ammo, a heater, or food. Use a quick **Market Value** trade.

**Twist ([Story Die](#story-die) 1)**: Trader offers a cheap turret blueprint.
**Complication ([Story Die](#story-die) 10)**: Trader leads danger to the camp.

**Example: Event B**
Oren trades spare scrap for a heater and keeps the group warm at night.

---

### Event C - The Weather Knife (Any Time)

**When it applies**
Whenever you want to push tension.

**How it works**
A sudden cold snap and windstorm.
* If shelter is weak, everyone gains **+1 [Stress](#stress)**.
* Cooking and Rest actions are harder.
* Hypothermia risk in the night fight.

**Example: Event C**
The storm hits at Dusk. The group rushes to finish a barricade before night.

---

## The Night Threat (Finale)

### Option 1 - Manhunter Pack

**When it applies**
When you want a chaotic beast fight.

**How it works**
A pack of **6–10 maddened wolves or feral dogs** charges at night and targets the weakest [Colonist](#colonist).

**Example: Manhunter Pack**
Sana kites the pack while Marla covers from behind the barricade.

---

### Option 2 - Desperate Raiders

**When it applies**
When you want a social standoff that turns violent.

**How it works**
**2–4 raiders** attempt intimidation, then attack if refused.

**Twist**: One raider is barely a teenager.
**Complication**: They set fire to the shelter.

**Example: Desperate Raiders**
The group refuses demands and a short Social showdown erupts into combat.

---

## Victory, Fallout, and Debrief

### Win Conditions

**When it applies**
At dawn after the night threat.

**How it works**
The colony wins if:
* At least **two colonists** are alive.
* The group has **shelter** and either **food** or **basic defenses**.

**Example: Win Conditions**
Two colonists survive and the shelter holds. The group wins even if supplies are low.

---

### Rewards (Light Campaign Hook)

**When it applies**
After a successful one-shot.

**How it works**
* Everyone gains **+10 Skill Points** in one used skill.
* The colony gains **1 Research Point**.
* The group chooses a Storyteller mode for the next session.

**[Edge](#edge) cases**
* Full advancement rules are in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**Example: Rewards**
Sana adds **+10 Skill Points** to Shooting, and the group chooses **Cassandra Classic** for Session 2.

---

## Storyteller Cheat Sheet

**Pacing Outline**
1. Dawn: crash, shelter decision
2. Midday: injured wanderer
3. Dusk: trader, last preparations
4. Night: raid or manhunters
5. Morning: aftermath and hook

**Use the [Story Die](#story-die) Loudly**
* **1**: Reward bravery, ingenuity, or kindness.
* **10**: Force a hard choice or reveal a second-layer threat.

---

## Why This One-Shot Works

* Shows the [Story Die](#story-die) identity.
* Proves Struggle still moves the story forward.
* Delivers the RimWorld pressure loop.
* Introduces colony play without heavy bookkeeping.

---

## Optional Add-Ons (If You Have Time)
