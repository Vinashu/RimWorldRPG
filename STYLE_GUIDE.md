# 🎯 Target Style: Hybrid (Procedural Core + Readable Tone)

**Philosophy**

* Players should *understand rules on first read.*
* GMs should be able to *run without guessing.*
* The book should still feel like RimWorld: harsh, story-driven, a bit darkly humorous.

So:

* Procedures = explicit
* Lore/flavour = concise but evocative
* Examples = practical, not decorative

# ✅ STYLE GUIDE (Hybrid Version)

## 1) Voice & Tone

* Clear, direct, conversational.
* Short paragraphs.
* Active voice.
* Light RimWorld flavour text allowed, but never inside rules text.

**Good**

> Roll 2d10 and take the highest. Compare to the tier table.

**Avoid**

> The colonist, in their desperate struggle for survival, might consider rolling...

## 2) Rule Presentation Format

Every mechanic should follow:

### **Name**

**When it applies**
**How it works (steps)**
**Edge cases**
**Example**

Example structure:

```
### Cover

When a character is partially protected by terrain or objects.

How it works:
1. GM determines cover level (Light or Heavy).
2. Light cover: +1 tier to defense.
3. Heavy cover: +2 tiers to defense.

Edge cases:
- Cover does not stack with shields.

Example:
Rurik hides behind a stone wall (Heavy Cover).  
He gains +2 tiers to defense against ranged attacks.
```

## 3) Dice Notation

* Always `XdY` (e.g., 2d10)
* Story Die tiers always capitalized
* Tiers referenced consistently (Tier I–V or numeric — pick one and stick to it)

---

## 4) Terminology Consistency

One term = one meaning.

Examples:

* “Colonist” (not survivor/player/hero interchangeably)
* “Break” for mental breaks (not meltdown/episode randomly)
* “Storyteller” for GM-facing system layer

Codex should normalize this later.

---

## 5) Examples Rule

Every new subsystem must include:

* At least 1 worked example
* Real numbers and dice results
* A clear outcome

Examples should:

* Use named colonists
* Reflect realistic RimWorld chaos (injuries, mood swings, etc.)

---

## 6) Lore vs Rules Separation

Use callouts or italics for flavour.

Rules text must be scannable:

* bullet points
* numbered steps
* tables
