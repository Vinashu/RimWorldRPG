# Missing Content Report

Based on the comparison between `rulebook_toc.md` and the existing chapters (`chapter_01` - `chapter_07`), the following content is missing or incomplete:

## Chapter 4: Combat & Survival
*   **Needs**: Detailed rules for Food, Rest, Recreation, Beauty, and Comfort are mentioned but not fully fleshed out with mechanics.
*   **Mood & Stress**: The **Mental Break system** and **Panic Tables** need specific triggers and effects tables (currently only briefly mentioned).
*   **Caravans**: Rules for **Travel speed**, **Foraging**, and **Ambushes** on the World Map are missing.

## Chapter 7: The Rim (World & Enemies)
*   **Biomes**: Descriptions and mechanics for **Desert, Tundra, Jungle, Temperate Forest** (e.g., temperature effects, movement penalties, bonus for activities).
*   **Bestiary**: Stats and abilities for **Animals**, **Insects** (Megascarab, Spelopede), and **Mechanoids**.

## Chapter 8: The Storyteller (GM Section)
*   **Entire Chapter Missing**:
    *   **Running the Game**: Pacing and Tone.
    *   **Scenarios**: Setup guides for "Crashlanded", "Naked Brutality", etc.
    *   **Event Generation**: Tables for Minor, Major, and Extreme events.
    *   **Quests**: System for generating missions and rewards.
    *   **Wealth Management**: How to scale difficulty based on colony wealth.

## Action Plan
1.  **Expand Chapter 4**: Add sections for Needs, detailed Mental Break tables, and Caravan travel rules.
2.  **Expand Chapter 7**: Add Biome effects and a Bestiary with stat blocks.
3.  **Create Chapter 8**: Write the Game Master's guide with Event tables and Storyteller advice.
