# 🎨 1) RimWorldRPG Visual Style (Art Bible)

### Core Vibe

* Sci-fi frontier survival
* Hopeful but harsh
* Cozy-dangerous (RimWorld tone)
* Stylized, not realistic
* Slightly playful, not grimdark

### Art Style Keywords

Use these *consistently* in prompts:

> stylized sci-fi illustration, semi-cartoon, clean line art, soft cel shading, pleasant color palette, slightly desaturated tones, readable shapes, graphic-novel style, top-down or isometric friendly design, game-concept-art style

### World Aesthetic

* Frontier planets
* Scrappy colonies
* Modular sci-fi structures
* Mixed tech levels (hi-tech + improvised gear)
* Clean silhouettes (important for rulebook readability)

### Color Direction

* Muted earth tones + accent colors
* Dusty oranges, soft blues, sage greens
* Avoid neon overload
* Avoid ultra-dark palettes

Think:

> “survival, but charming”

# 🧍 2) Core Character Consistency

Define 3–4 recurring colonists.
They become your “mascots” across examples.

### Example Cast

**Rurik**

* Rugged colonist
* Short beard
* Practical armor, tool belt
* Warm personality

**Mira**

* Medic / researcher
* Light sci-fi coat
* Tablet/scanner
* Calm, intelligent look

**Jax**

* Shooter / hunter
* Patchwork armor
* Rifle
* Alert stance

**Tala**

* Builder / engineer
* Utility backpack
* Gloves, gadgets
* Curious expression

👉 Always reuse names + traits in prompts.
This creates subconscious cohesion.

# 🚫 4) Negative Prompt Block

Use this in every generation to keep cohesion:

grimdark, horror, gore,
cyberpunk neon, anime sparkle eyes,
overly dramatic lighting,
blurry, messy composition,
dark muddy colors
```

This prevents style drift.

Consistency comes from:

* same style keywords
* same characters

Not from one giant prompt.
