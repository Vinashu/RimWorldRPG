# Chapter 1: Introduction & Core Mechanics

## Welcome to the Rim

You are stranded. You are lightyears from the glitterworlds, on a lawless frontier planet known as a **Rimworld**. There is no government here, no safety net, and no faster-than-light travel to take you home.

### What is this Game?
This is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG), a conversation between friends where you build a story together.

*   **The Storyteller (ST)**: The host of the game. They describe the world, play the enemies (Raiders, Mechanoids), and control the flow of the story. They are not your enemy; they are the director of the drama.
*   **The Players**: You. You each control a **Colonist** (your character). You make decisions, roll dice, and try to keep your colony alive.

### The Rim Experience
In this game, you will tell the story of your colony's struggle and triumph.
*   **Build**: You will construct a base from scratch—bedrooms, freezers, killboxes, and hospitals.
*   **Survive**: You will manage starvation, disease, and mental breaks.
*   **Defend**: You will fight off raids from savage Tribals, high-tech Pirates, swarming Insects, and cold Mechanoids.
*   **Explore**: You will form caravans to trade with neighbors, complete quests, and raid enemy outposts.
*   **Escape**: Your ultimate goal is to survive long enough to build a ship and leave this cursed planet... or die trying.

## The Core Mechanic: The Story Die System

When a Colonist attempts an action with an uncertain outcome—shooting a raider, performing surgery, or negotiating a trade—you make a **Colonist Roll**.

### The Dice
You roll **two 10-sided dice (2d10)**.
1.  **The Base Die** (Any color, e.g., White): Represents your raw effort.
2.  **The Story Die** (Red): Represents the chaotic nature of the Rim.

**The Formula:**
> **Result = Base Die + Story Die + Attribute + Skill Modifier**
> 
*Skill Modifier = Floor(Skill Points / 10)*

### Tiers of Success
The total Result determines what happens. We don't use a binary Pass/Fail. **You almost always succeed, but at what cost?**

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You hit the raider but deal half damage. You bandage the wound but use 2x Medicine. You make the deal but pay 20% more. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal exactly as intended. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You achieve your goal with style. You deal double damage, heal instantly, or get a discount. |

### Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.
*   **Edge (+2)**: You have a minor advantage, like high ground or a good tool.
*   **Bane (-2)**: You have a minor disadvantage, like darkness or pain.
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The same in the other way around.
*   **Augmented (3d10)**: You have a major advantage (bionics, drugs, perfect position). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Highest**. Replaces standard roll (Edge/Bane do not apply).
*   **Impaired (3d10)**: You have a major disadvantage (blindness, toxicity, suppression). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Lowest**. Replaces standard roll (Edge/Bane do not apply).

*Note: Edge/Bane are additive. Augmented/Impaired replace the standard roll.*

*Note: The result of the Story Die is **always** applied, even if its value is discarded in an Augmented or Impaired roll.*

### Pushing Your Luck
Life on the Rim is desperate. You can push yourself beyond your limits.
*   **The Push**: You can voluntarily add **+1d6** to your roll.
*   **The Risk**: If the **d6** rolls a **1**, you trigger a **Panic Check** immediately after the action (regardless of success or failure). 

---

## The Story Die Effects

The Red Die (Story Die) adds narrative twists beyond simple numbers.

### Rolling a 1: Twist of Fate
If the Story Die shows a **1**, something unexpected but positive happens.
*   **Effect**: You gain **1 Inspiration Point** OR you gain an **Edge** on your next roll.
*   *Narrative*: You struggled to build the wall (Tier 1), but you found a better way to lay the bricks for next time.
*   *Narrative*: Your shot hit the enemy armour (Tier 1), but you were able to spot a weakness in their armor.

### Rolling a 10: Complication
If the Story Die shows a **10**, something dangerous happens.
*   **Effect**: You suffer a **Bane** on your next roll, or it will affect your stress level or mood.
*   *Narrative*: You shot the mechanoid perfectly (Tier 3), but your barrel overheated. Your next shot will be harder.
*   *Narrative*: You work harder to finish a section of the wall (Tier 3), but you are too tired and feel stressed.

### Inspiration Points
You can spend an Inspiration Point to:
*   **Reroll one die** in a future roll.
*   **Add +1d6** to a future roll.
*   **Avoid a Mental Break** (reduce Stress by 1d4).
*  **Give an edge**: to a colonist.
*  **Give a bane**: to a enemy.

## Time & Scale

Time on the Rim is tracked in specific units to manage survival.

### The Day
A standard day has 24 hours, divided into **Action Slots** for Base Building:
1.  **Morning** (5 hours)
2.  **Afternoon** (5 hours)
3.  **Evening** (5 hours)
4.  **Night** (8 hours - Sleep/Rest)
*The remaining hour is for meals and transitions.*

### The Quadrum
A year is divided into 4 seasons called **Quadrums**, each lasting **15 Days**.
1.  **Aprimay** (Early Spring)
2.  **Jugust** (Late Summer)
3.  **Septober** (Early Autumn)
4.  **Decembary** (Late Winter)

### Movement Scale
*   **Combat**: 1 Square = 1 Meter. Base Speed is **6 Squares**.
*   **World Map**: 1 Hex = ~1 Day of travel for a caravan.

# Chapter 2: Character Creation

In RimWorld, no one is a blank slate. Every colonist has a history—a childhood on a glitterworld, a career as a space marine, or a dark past as a pirate.

We use a **Lifepath System** to generate your Colonist. You will roll for your background, survive terms of service, and emerge as a scarred but capable survivor.

> **Example: The Table**
> John and Mary are ready to start playing. John will act as the Storyteller (ST), and Mary will be a Player (Colonist).

---

## Step 1: Attributes
Every Colonist starts with the following array. Assign these numbers to your 4 Attributes:
> **+2, +1, +0, -1**

*   **Vigor**: Physical power and endurance.
*   **Dexterity**: Precision and speed.
*   **Mind**: Intellect and analysis.
*   **Spirit**: Empathy and willpower.

> **Example: Choosing Attributes**
> **John**: "Mary, you need to assign values to your four attributes using this array: +2, +1, 0, -1. Think about what your character is good at."
> **Mary**: "I want to create a female colonist. She will be very smart, so I'll put the **+2 in Mind**. She's wise and determined, so **+1 in Spirit**. She likes physical activities but isn't a soldier, so **0 in Dexterity** and **-1 in Vigor**."

---

## Step 2: Childhood
Your early years define your potential. Choose or Roll (1d10) for your Childhood Backstory.
*   **Skill Points**: You gain raw points (0-30).
*   **Modifier**: Your Skill Modifier is `Floor(Skill Points / 10)`.
    *   *Example*: 15 Points = +1 Modifier. 20 Points = +2 Modifier.

| d10 | Backstory | Skill Points | Trait |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Urchin** | +10 Melee, +10 Social | **Scrapper**: Ignore the first Bane in melee combat. |
| 2 | **Vatgrown** | +1 Vigor (Attr), +10 Shooting | **Dull**: -2 to Social rolls, but +10 Mood. |
| 3 | **Noble Scion** | +1 Spirit (Attr), +10 Social | **Greedy**: Mood penalty if bedroom is not impressive. |
| 4 | **Midworld Student** | +1 Mind (Attr), +10 Intellectual | **Fast Learner**: +1 XP gain per session. |
| 5 | **Feral Child** | +10 Animals, +10 Plants | **Wild**: Cannot do Intellectual tasks. |
| 6 | **War Refugee** | +10 Shooting, +10 Medical | **Pessimist**: -5 Mood permanently. |
| 7 | **Caveworld Tender** | +10 Mining, +10 Plants | **Undergrounder**: No "Cabin Fever", hates outdoors. |
| 8 | **Industrial Orphan** | +10 Crafting, +10 Construction | **Industrious**: +1 to all Work Speed rolls. |
| 9 | **Sheriff** | +10 Shooting, +10 Melee | **Trigger-Happy**: -1 Accuracy, but +1 Action per turn. |
| 10 | **Pop Idol** | +20 Social | **Beautiful**: +2 to all Social interactions. |

> **Example: Childhood**
> **John**: "Okay, now we need to know where she came from. You can choose or roll for a Childhood."
> **Mary**: "I'll let the dice decide." *(Rolls a 6)*. "Oh, nice! I'm a **War Refugee**. That fits. She had to be smart to survive the war."
> **John**: "Perfect. That gives you **+10 Shooting** and **+10 Medical**, and the **Pessimist** trait."

---

## Step 3: Adulthood (The Terms)
You serve **Terms** of 4 years. You must take at least **1 Term**, and can take up to **4**.
*   **Age**: Start at 14 + (4 x Terms).
*   **Skill Cap**: You cannot start with more than **30 Points** (+3) in any skill.

**For each Term:**
1.  **Choose a Career**.
2.  **Roll Survival (1d10 + Attribute)** vs DC 12.
    *   *Success*: You survive unscathed.
    *   *Failure*: You gain a **Scar** or **Addiction** (see Effects below), but you still complete the term.
    *   **Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: You barely survive. Gain a **Random Negative Trait** (Roll on Table B).
3.  **Gain Skills**: Increase the skill points. If increasing a skill would push it above the **30 Point** cap, you must allocate the excess points to any other skill listed in your current Career.
4.  **Roll Event (1d10)**: Each career has a 10-line table. When you hit an entry, resolve the **first outcome** listed. If you roll that same entry again in a later term, take the **second outcome**, then the third, then the fourth—no duplicate re-rolls needed.
    *   **Critical Success (Natural 10)**: You have a life-changing moment. Gain a **Random Positive Trait** (Roll on Table A) in addition to the Event result.

> **Example: First Term**
> **Mary**: "For her first term, she tried to find peace. I'll choose the **Drifter** career."
> **John**: "Roll for Survival. You need a 12 using Dexterity."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 2d10 + 0)* "I got a 14! She survived."
> **John**: "Great. Now pick two skills and roll for an event."
> **Mary**: "I'll take **Social** and **Plants**. For the event..." *(Rolls a 10)* "Found Treasure! I start with a Masterwork item."

> **Mary**: "Yes! That's perfect. She prefers the darkness."

> **John**: "Okay, Viper is ready. Now, how does the group arrive on the Rim?"
> **Mary**: "Since we are doing a standard game, let's go with **Crashlanded**."
> **John**: "Crashlanded it is. You wake up to the screaming of sirens and tearing metal as your ship breaks apart in orbit..."

# Chapter 3: Skills & Checks

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, you roll the dice.

---

## The Core Mechanic
To resolve any challenge, roll **2d10** and add your relevant **Attribute** and **Skill Modifier**.

> **Result = 2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**

> **Example: Basic Check**
> **John**: "Viper is trying to negotiate a lower price for the medicine. This is a Standard Social check (DC 14)."
> **Mary**: "Okay, Viper has **Spirit +1** and **Social 25 (+2)**. So I add +3 to my roll."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 2d10)* "I got a 6 and a 7. Total is 13 + 3 = 16. Success!"

### Difficulty Class (DC)
The Game Master (Storyteller) sets the DC based on the complexity of the task.

| Difficulty | DC | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Routine** | 10 | Climbing a ladder, cooking a simple meal. |
| **Standard** | 14 | Shooting a raider, performing surgery, negotiating a trade. |
| **Hard** | 18 | Hacking a mechanoid, surgery in the dark, hitting a target behind cover. |
| **Extreme** | 22 | Surviving a plague without medicine, convincing a pirate king to surrender. |

### Skill Modifiers
Your **Skill Points** (0-30) determine your modifier for the roll.
*   **0-9 Points**: +0
*   **10-19 Points**: +1
*   **20-29 Points**: +2
*   **30 Points**: +3 (Master)

---

## Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.

### Minor Modifiers (+2 / -2)
*   **Edge (+2)**: Minor advantage (High ground, good tools).
*   **Bane (-2)**: Minor disadvantage (Darkness, poor tools).

> **Example: Edge & Bane**
> **John**: "You're shooting at the raider, but it's dark (**Bane**). However, you have a high-quality scope (**Edge**)."
> **Mary**: "So the Edge and Bane cancel out?"
> **John**: "Exactly. Just roll straight. 2d10 + Dexterity + Shooting."

### Double Modifiers
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.

> **Example: Double Edge**
> **John**: "You have the high ground (**Edge**) AND the raider is out in the open (**Edge**). That's **Double Edge**."
> **Mary**: "So if I succeed, the result is upgraded?"
> **John**: "Yes. A Success becomes a Critical Success. A Failure becomes a Success."

### Cancel Modifiers
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The same in the other way around.

### Major Modifiers (3d10)
*   **Augmented**: Major advantage (Bionics, drugs, perfect position). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Highest**.
*   **Impaired**: Major disadvantage (Blindness, toxicity, suppression). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Lowest**.

> **Example: Augmented**
> **John**: "Viper has a bionic eye targeting system. That counts as **Augmented** for this shot."
> **Mary**: "Okay, I roll **3d10** and keep the highest two."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 3, 8, 9)* "I keep the 8 and 9. Total 17 + Modifiers."

*Note: You can not have both Edge and Augmented on the same roll.*

*Note: The result of the Story Die is **always** applied, even its value is discarded in an Augmented or Impaired roll.*

---

## Pushing Your Luck
Life on the Rim is desperate. You can push yourself beyond your limits.
*   **The Push**: You can voluntarily add **+1d6** to your roll.
*   **The Risk**: If the **d6** rolls a **1**, you trigger a **Panic Check** immediately after the action (regardless of success or failure).

> **Example: The Push**
> **Mary**: "I rolled an 11... I needed a 12 to fix the generator! Can I push it?"
> **John**: "You can. Add **1d6** to the total, but if you roll a **1** on that die, you panic."
> **Mary**: "I have to try. Come on..." *(Rolls d6)* "I got a 4! Total is 15. I fixed it!"
> **John**: "You wipe the sweat from your brow. The generator hums to life."

---

# Chapter 4: Combat & Damage

When diplomacy fails, the Rim demands violence. Combat is dangerous, bloody, and often fatal.

---

## The Combat Sequence
Combat is chaotic but structured. We use a **Dynamic Turn System**.

### 1. Initiative Roll
At the start of combat, the Players make a **Group Initiative Roll**.
*   Roll **1d10**.
*   **6-10**: **Players go first**.
*   **1-5**: **Enemies go first**.

> **Example: Initiative**
> **John**: "The raiders burst through the door! Roll for Initiative."
> **Mary**: "Okay, rolling a d10." *(Rolls a 7)*. "I got a 7!"
> **John**: "That's between 6 and 10. The Players go first. Viper acts before the raiders."

### 2. The Flow of Battle
Combat turns **alternate** between sides.
1.  **Side A** (Winner of Initiative) picks **one character** to act.
2.  That character takes their full **Turn**.
3.  **Side B** picks **one character** to act.
4.  That character takes their full **Turn**.
5.  Repeat until all characters on both sides have acted. This completes the **Round**.

*Note: If one side has more combatants, they take all remaining turns at the end of the round.*

---

## The Action Economy (4 AP)
On your turn, you have **4 Action Points (AP)** to spend. You can spend them in any combination.

### Actions
*   **Attack (2 AP)**: Make a Shooting or Melee attack.
*   **Move (1 AP)**: Move up to your Speed (Default 6 squares).
*   **Minor Action (1 AP)**:
    *   **Aim**: Gain **Augmented** on your next attack this turn.
    *   **Take Cover**: Gain **Edge** on Defense (if applicable) or impose **Bane** on attackers.
    *   **Aid**: Give **Edge** to an ally's next roll.
    *   **Use Item**: Drink a potion, reload, or switch weapons.

### Common Combos
*   **The Skirmisher**: Move (1) + Attack (2) + Take Cover (1).
*   **The Turret**: Attack (2) + Attack (2).
*   **The Sprinter**: Move (1) + Move (1) + Move (1) + Move (1).
*   **The Sniper**: Aim (1) + Attack (2) + Move (1).

> **Example: Spending AP**
> **Mary**: "Viper has 4 AP. She's currently exposed, so I want to get to safety."
> **Mary**: "I'll spend **1 AP** to Move behind the sandbags. Then I'll spend **1 AP** to Aim at the leader."
> **Mary**: "I have 2 AP left, so I'll spend **2 AP** to Attack with my rifle."

---

## Attack Resolution: "Always Hit"
In this system, **attacks always land**. The question is not *if* you hit, but *how well* you hit.

**The Roll**:
> **2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**

*   **Shooting**: Uses **Dexterity**.
*   **Melee**: Uses **Vigor**.

**The Tiers**:
Compare your total result to the Tiers below.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Weak Hit** | You graze the target. Deal **Half Damage**. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Solid Hit** | You strike true. Deal **Full Damage**. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Critical Hit** | A devastating blow. Deal **Double Damage** AND roll for a **Major Injury**. |

> **Example: Attack Roll**
> **John**: "You're Aiming, so you have **Augmented** on this shot. Roll 3d10 and keep the highest two."
> **Mary**: "My Dexterity is 0 and Shooting is +1 (10 points). So I add +1 to the roll."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 4, 8, 9)* "I keep 8 and 9. That's 17 + 1 = 18."
> **John**: "18 is a **Tier 3: Critical Hit**! You hit him right in the head."

---

## Damage & Armor

### Calculating Damage
1.  **Determine Tier**: (Half, Full, or Double).
2.  **Apply Armor**: Subtract the target's **Armor Rating** from the damage.
3.  **Apply to HP**: Subtract the remaining damage from Health.

> **Damage = (Weapon Damage x Tier Multiplier) - Armor**

*Example: A Rifle (Damage 6) hits a Raider (Armor 2).*
*   *Tier 1*: (3) - 2 = **1 Damage**.
*   *Tier 2*: (6) - 2 = **4 Damage**.
*   *Tier 3*: (12) - 2 = **10 Damage** + Injury Roll.

> **Example: Dealing Damage**
> **John**: "Your Rifle does 6 Damage. Since it's a Tier 3 hit, you deal **Double Damage** (12)."
> **John**: "The Raider is wearing a Flak Vest (Armor 3). So, 12 - 3 = **9 Damage** to his HP."

### Health (HP)
> **Max HP = 10 + (Vigor x 2)**

### Major Injuries (Tier 3 Effect)
If you land a **Tier 3 Critical Hit**, roll **1d6** for an additional effect:

| d6 | Injury | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-3** | **Bleeding** | Target takes **1 Damage** at the start of every turn until Tended. |
| **4** | **Broken Bone** | Target suffers **Impaired** on all physical actions. Speed halved. |
| **5** | **Concussion** | Target suffers **Impaired** on all mental actions. Cannot use Skills. |
| **6** | **Severed / Lethal** | Target loses a limb OR is immediately **Downed**. |

> **Example: Critical Effect**
> **John**: "Since it was a Critical Hit, roll 1d6 for a Major Injury."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls a 6)* "A 6! What does that do?"
> **John**: "**Severed / Lethal**. You blew his head off. He's down immediately."

---

## Death & Downed
*   **0 HP**: You are **Downed**. You are unconscious and helpless.
*   **Death**: If you take damage while Downed, or if you are not tended within **1 hour**, you die.
# Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy

Survival on the Rim requires the right tools. A sharp knife, a warm parka, and a pocket full of silver can make the difference between life and death.

---

## Economy
The universal currency of the Rim is **Silver**.
*   **Starting Wealth**: Determined by your Scenario (Chapter 2).
*   **Trade**: You can trade with visiting caravans or orbital trade ships (requires Comms Console).

### Market Value & Trading
**Market Value** is the base worth of an item, calculated roughly as:
> **Market Value = (Material Cost) + (Crafting Points × 0.5)**

When trading, prices are adjusted by the trader's **Social** skill:
*   **Base Buy Price**: 140% of Market Value.
*   **Base Sell Price**: 60% of Market Value.
*   **Social Bonus**: For every level of Social, improve prices by **2%**.
    *   *Example*: Social 10 gives +20% better prices (Buy at 120%, Sell at 80%).
    *   *Max Bonus*: ±40% (at Social 20).

> **Example: Trading**
> **John**: "The orbital trader offers to buy your sculptures. The base value is 500 Silver."
> **Mary**: "Viper does the talking. She has **Social 40 (+4)**."
> **John**: "Okay, the base sell price is 60% (300 Silver). With Social 40 (Level 4), you get +8%."
> **Mary**: "So 68%? That's 340 Silver."
> **John**: "Deal."

### Common Item Values
| Item | Market Value | Materials | Crafting Points (CP) | Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Meal (Simple)** | 15 | 10 Food | 10 | Neolithic 1 |
| **Meal (Fine)** | 25 | 20 Food | 20 | Medieval 2 |
| **Medicine (Herbal)** | 10 | - | - | Neolithic 2 |
| **Medicine (Industrial)** | 50 | 3 Cloth, 1 Neutroamine | 40 | Industrial 2 |
| **Component** | 30 | 12 Steel | 60 | Industrial 1 |
| **Advanced Component** | 200 | 1 Component, 20 Steel, 10 Plasteel, 3 Gold | 200 | Spacer 1 |

### Item Quality
When an item is finished (CP requirement met), make a final **Crafting Check** to determine its quality.

*   **Tier 1 (11-)**: **Normal**. Standard stats.
*   **Tier 2 (12-16)**: **Good**. **+1 Accuracy/Damage** (Weapons) or **+1 Armor** (Apparel).
*   **Tier 3 (17+)**: **Masterwork**. **+2 Stats**. Value x1.5.
*   **Critical (Natural 10)**: **Legendary**. **+3 Stats**. Value x2. Gain Art/Name.

> **Example: Crafting**
> **Mary**: "Viper finishes the Flak Vest. It took 80 CP. Now for the Quality roll."
> **John**: "Roll **Dexterity + Crafting**."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 15)*. "Tier 2! It's a **Good** Flak Vest."
> **John**: "Nice. It has **Armor 3** instead of 2."

---

# Chapter 6: Colony Management

Building a thriving colony requires more than just survival; it requires industry, research, and expansion.

---

## Base Management

The Base is the heart of the game. It has its own stats and resources.

### Resources
We track 5 abstract resource categories:
1.  **Food**: Meals, pemmican, raw meat/veg.
2.  **Textile**: Leather, cloth, wool.
3.  **Ore**: Steel, plasteel, gold.
4.  **Components**: Machinery parts, electronics.
5.  **Medicine**: Herbal meds, glitterworld meds.

### Daily Actions
The day is divided into **4 Periods**: **Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night**.

**1. Planning Phase**: At the start of the day, each player decides what their character will do for each of the 4 periods. You can assign a specific task (Farming, Building, etc.) or choose to **Rest/Sleep**.

**2. Resolution Phase**: Once all plans are set, players make the necessary Skill Checks for each active period.

| Action | Roll | Tier 1 (11-) | Tier 2 (12-16) | Tier 3 (17+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Farming** | **Mind + Plants** | **1 Food** | **2 Food, 1 Textile** | **4 Food, 2 Textile** |
| **Animal Husbandry** | **Spirit + Animals** | **1 Food** (Milk/Eggs) | **1 Food, 1 Textile** (Wool) | **2 Food, 2 Textile** OR **+1 Taming** |
| **Hunting** | **Dexterity + Shooting** | **1 Food** | **2 Food, 1 Textile** (Leather) | **4 Food, 2 Textile** |
| **Mining** | **Vigor + Mining** | **1 Ore** | **2 Ore** | **3 Ore, 1 Component** |
| **Cooking** | **Dexterity + Cooking** | Convert **2 Food** -> **2 Meals** | Convert **2 Food** -> **3 Meals** | Convert **2 Food** -> **4 Meals** |
| **Crafting** | **Dexterity + Crafting** | **1 CP** towards Item | **3 CP** towards Item | **5 CP** towards Item |
| **Building** | **Vigor + Construction** | **1 CP** towards Building | **3 CP** towards Building | **5 CP** towards Building |
| **Researching** | **Mind + Intellectual** | **20 RP** | **50 RP** | **100 RP** |
| **Social** | **Spirit + Social** | Maintain Relations | **+1 Relation** | **+2 Relation** or **Trade Bonus** |
| **Healing** | **Mind + Medical** | Tend **1 Wound** | Tend **2 Wounds** | Tend **All Wounds** |
| **Artistic** | **Spirit + Artistic** | **1 CP** towards Art | **3 CP** towards Art | **5 CP** towards Art |

> **Example: Daily Planning**
> **John**: "It's a new day. The colony is low on food and we need those sandbags finished. What is Viper's plan?"
> **Mary**: "Okay, here is my schedule:
> *   **Morning**: Hunting. We need meat.
> *   **Afternoon**: Building. I want to finish the sandbags.
> *   **Evening**: Researching. I'll put in some hours on Gunsmithing.
> *   **Night**: Sleeping."
>
> **John**: "Sounds like a busy day. Let's resolve the rolls."
> **Mary**: "First, **Hunting** (Dex + Shooting)... *(Rolls 14)*. Tier 2! **2 Food, 1 Textile**."
> **Mary**: "Next, **Building** (Vigor + Construction)... *(Rolls 18)*. Tier 3! **5 CP**. The sandbags are done!"
> **Mary**: "Finally, **Research** (Mind + Intellectual)... *(Rolls 9)*. Tier 1. Just **20 RP**."
> **John**: "A productive day. Viper collapses into bed, exhausted but satisfied."

---

## Construction & Infrastructure

Building structures requires **Materials** and **Construction Points (CP)**.
*   **Construction Speed**: A character generates CP equal to their **Construction Skill × 10** per hour.

> **Example: Building**
> **Mary**: "We need defenses. Viper spends the afternoon building sandbags."
> **John**: "Sandbags cost **10 CP**. Roll **Vigor + Construction**."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 18)*. "Tier 3! I generate **5 CP**."
> **John**: "You're halfway there. You'll need another slot to finish them."

### Structures
| Building | Materials | CP | Tech Req | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wall (Wood)** | 5 Wood | 10 | - | Flammable. |
| **Wall (Stone)** | 5 Stone Blocks | 20 | Medieval 1 | Durable. Fireproof. |
| **Door** | 25 Material | 30 | - | Slows movement if not held open. |
| **Bed** | 45 Wood/Steel | 60 | Neolithic 2 | Rest Effectiveness 100%. |
| **Table (2x2)** | 30 Wood/Steel | 50 | Neolithic 2 | Eating without table: -3 Mood. |
| **Research Bench** | 75 Steel, 25 Wood | 100 | - | Required for research. |
| **Comms Console** | 120 Steel, 4 Comp | 200 | Industrial 3 | Trade with orbital ships. |

### Power
| Building | Materials | CP | Tech Req | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wood Generator** | 100 Steel, 2 Comp | 150 | Industrial 1 | Consumes Wood. |
| **Solar Panel** | 100 Steel, 3 Comp | 200 | Industrial 3 | Power only during day. |
| **Battery** | 50 Steel, 2 Comp | 100 | Industrial 2 | Stores power. Explodes if wet. |

### Security & Defense
| Building | Materials | CP | Tech Req | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sandbags** | 5 Cloth | 10 | - | Provides Cover. |
| **Barricade** | 10 Wood/Steel | 20 | - | Provides Cover. |
| **Spike Trap** | 45 Material | 40 | - | 10 Dmg to first enemy stepping on it. |
| **Mini-Turret** | 100 Steel, 3 Comp | 250 | Industrial 2 | Auto-fires (Range 25, Dmg 4). |

### Defense Pool
Completed defensive structures add to the **Defense Pool**. During a Raid, players can spend Defense Points to:
*   **Negate an enemy success**.
*   **Reduce damage** taken by a Colonist.
*   **Prevent damage** to a building.

### Cover Mechanics
*   **Partial Cover**: Attacker suffers **Bane**.
*   **Full Cover**: Attacker suffers **Double Bane**.

---

## Research & Technology

Knowledge is power. To craft advanced items or build complex structures, you must first unlock the technology level required.

### The Research Process
1.  **Assign a Researcher**: A character spends an **Action Slot (4 hours)** working at a **Research Bench**.
2.  **Make a Research Check**: `Roll = 2d10 + Mind + Intellectual`

*   **Missing Lung**: **+1 Bane** on stamina rolls. Gain **+1 Stress** after exertion.
*   **Scars (Painful)**: Each scar imposes **-1 Mood**. 3+ scars adds **+1 Bane** to Social.

### Replacements

*   **Prosthetic**: Removes Banes. Ignore Speed penalties.
*   **Bionic**: Removes Banes. Gain **Edge** once per Scene on a roll using that limb.

### Stress & Mental Breaks
Colonists accumulate **Stress** from pushing rolls, witnessing death, starvation, or low Mood.

> **Example: Mental Break**
> **John**: "Viper is starving (+1 Stress) and witnessed a death yesterday (+1 Stress). Her current Stress is 5. Roll a Panic Check."
> **Mary**: "Rolling 1d6 + 5..." *(Rolls 4)*. "Total 9. That's a **Minor Break**."
> **John**: "Viper snaps. She goes on a **Binge**, eating the raw meat you just hunted."
