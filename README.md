> *"You are stranded. You are lightyears from the glitterworlds, on a lawless frontier planet known as a Rimworld. There is no government here, no safety net, and no faster-than-light travel to take you home."*

**RimWorld RPG** is a tabletop roleplaying game adaptation of the hit sci-fi colony sim. It translates the complex simulation of survival, psychology, and combat into a narrative-driven TTRPG experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎲 The Story Die System
A unique **2d10 mechanic** that prioritizes narrative outcomes over binary pass/fail results.
*   **Tiers of Success**: Every roll results in a **Struggle** (success at a cost), **Success**, or **Triumph** (critical success).
*   **The Story Die**: One of your dice (the Red Die) introduces **Twists of Fate** (unexpected boons) or **Complications** (narrative hurdles), keeping the story dynamic.

### 🧬 Lifepath Character Creation
Build deep, flawed, and unique colonists using a **Lifepath System**.
*   **Childhood & Adulthood**: Combine backgrounds like *Vatgrown Soldier* or *Caveworld Tender* to determine stats.
*   **Traits**: Gain gameplay-altering traits like *Cannibal*, *Pyromaniac*, or *Kind*.
*   **Incapable**: Just like the game, some colonists simply *refuse* to do certain work (e.g., "Incapable of Violence").

### 🧠 Survival & Psychology
It's not just about hit points.
*   **Needs System**: Manage Food, Rest, Recreation, Beauty, and Comfort.
*   **Mood & Mental Breaks**: Push your colonists too hard, and they might snap—going on a **Food Binge**, wandering in a **Daze**, or starting a **Social Fight**.

### 🏰 Colony Management
*   **Base Building**: Construct walls, killboxes, freezers, and hospitals.
*   **Work Priorities**: Assign colonists to roles like Warden, Cook, or Hunter.
*   **Research**: Advance through the tech tree from Neolithic bows to Spacer charge rifles.
