# Survival & Combat Rules

## Stress & Mental Breaks

Life on the Rim is hard. Colonists accumulate **Stress** which can lead to a **Mental Break**.

### Gaining Stress
*   **Pushing a Roll**: +1 Stress (voluntary).
*   **Witnessing Death**: +1 Stress.
*   **Starvation/Exhaustion**: +1 Stress per day.
*   **Low Mood**: If Mood < Threshold, gain +1 Stress per scene.

### The Stress Die
For every point of Stress, add **1d6** to your dice pool for ALL rolls.
*   **Benefit**: The d6 result adds to your total (helping you hit Tier 2/3).
*   **Risk**: If you roll a **1** on any Stress Die, you trigger a **Panic Check**.

### Panic Check (Mental Break)
Roll `1d6 + Current Stress`. Consult the table:

| Result | Break Type | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-6** | **Anxious** | **Trembling**: -2 to all Agility rolls for 1 hour. |
| **7-9** | **Minor Break** | **Hide in Room**: Character refuses to act for 1d4 hours. |
| **10-12** | **Major Break** | **Sad Wander**: Character walks towards danger, ignoring commands. |
| **13+** | **Extreme Break** | **Berserk**: Character attacks nearest creature (friend or foe) for 1d6 rounds. |

*Relief*: Stress is reset to 0 after a full night's sleep in a decent bed, or by "relaxing socially" (Social check).

## Combat

Combat is played in **Rounds**.

### Initiative
Roll `Agility + Shooting/Melee`. Highest acts first.

### Actions
On your turn, you can Move and take one Action.
*   **Attack**: Make a Colonist Roll (Shooting or Melee).
*   **Take Cover**: Gain **Edge** on defense.
*   **Rescue**: Drag a downed ally.

### Damage & Wounds
We do not use HP for everything. We use a **Wound System** for major hits.

*   **Tier 1 Hit (Glance)**: Target loses 1d4 HP.
*   **Tier 2 Hit (Solid)**: Target loses 1d10 HP.
*   **Tier 3 Hit (Critical)**: Target takes a **Wound** (e.g., Bleeding, Broken Bone) AND loses 1d10 HP.

**Death**: If HP reaches 0, the Colonist is **Downed** (unconscious, bleeding out). They die in `Vigor` rounds unless tended.

### Cover
*   **Partial Cover**: Attacker suffers **Bane**.
*   **Full Cover**: Attacker suffers **Double Bane**.

## Base Building (The Colony Phase)

The Base is the heart of the game. It has its own stats and resources.

### Resources
We track 5 abstract resource categories:
1.  **Food**: Meals, pemmican, raw meat/veg.
2.  **Textile**: Leather, cloth, wool.
3.  **Ore**: Steel, plasteel, gold.
4.  **Components**: Machinery parts, electronics.
5.  **Medicine**: Herbal meds, glitterworld meds.

### Construction & Defense
*   **Construction Points (CP)**: Every building project has a cost (e.g., Turret = 5 CP).
    *   **Construction Roll**: Tier 1 = 1 CP, Tier 2 = 3 CP, Tier 3 = 5 CP.
*   **Defense Pool**: Completed defensive structures (walls, sandbags, turrets) add to the **Defense Pool**.
    *   **Burn Defense**: During a Raid, players can spend Defense Points to:
        *   Negate an enemy success.
        *   Reduce damage taken by a Colonist.
        *   Prevent damage to a building.

### Daily Actions
Players assign Colonists to tasks:
*   **Farming** (Plants): High Food, Low Textile.
*   **Hunting** (Shooting/Animals): Medium Food, Medium Textile.
*   **Mining** (Mining): High Ore, Low Components.
*   **Crafting** (Crafting): Convert Ore/Textile into Weapons/Apparel.
