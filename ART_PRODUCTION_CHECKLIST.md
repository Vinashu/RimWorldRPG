# 🧠 Smart Production Rule (remember this)

> If a rule is confusing → add a diagram
> If a page is dense → add a spot illustration
> If a chapter feels dry → add flavor art
> If something is clear → don’t add art

Art solves problems — it shouldn’t create work.

# ⚡ Suggested Workflow

While Codex:
✔ Refines rulebook text
✔ Maintains glossary
✔ Fixes consistency

You:
✔ Generate Phase 1 visuals
✔ Lock character references
✔ Then move to chapter art

Parallel pipeline = fast progress.

# 🔔 Reminder (as requested!)

👉 Next step after this:

**B) Cover art direction that sells the game instantly**
AND
