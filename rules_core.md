# Core Rules: RimWorld TTRPG

## The Story Die System (Resolution Mechanic)

When a Colonist attempts an action with an uncertain outcome, they make a **Colonist Roll**.

**Formula:** `1d10 (Base) + 1d10 (Story Die) + Attribute + Skill`

*   **Base Die**: Standard d10.
*   **Story Die (Red)**: A special d10 that adds narrative twists.

### The Story Die Effects
*   **Rolls 1 (Twist of Fate)**: The result is likely low. **Benefit**: You gain 1 **Inspiration Point**. You fail, but learn something or find an unexpected opportunity.
*   **Rolls 10 (Complication)**: The result is likely high. **Penalty**: A **Complication** occurs. You succeed, but something breaks, you make noise, or you offend someone.

### Tiers of Success
The total result (Base + Story + Modifiers) determines the outcome tier.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Struggle** | **Failure**, or **Success with a Major Cost**. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Success** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Triumph** | **Critical Success**. You achieve your goal with style/speed. |
