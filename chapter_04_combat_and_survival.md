# Chapter 4: Survival & Combat

Life on the Rim is a constant struggle against hunger, madness, and violent death. This chapter covers the rules for keeping your colonists alive—both physically and mentally.

---

## Part 1: Survival & Needs

Your colonists are not just stats on a page; they are people with needs. Ignoring these needs leads to **Stress**, and eventually, **Mental Breaks**.

### The 5 Core Needs
1.  **Food**: Colonists must eat every day.
    *   *Requirement*: 2 Meals per day.
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** per missed meal. After 3 days, start taking **1d10 Damage** per day (Starvation).
2.  **Rest**: Colonists must sleep.
    *   *Requirement*: 8 hours of sleep.
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** per night of poor/missed sleep. Become **Fatigued** (-2 to all pools).
3.  **Recreation**: "All work and no play makes a dull boy."
    *   *Requirement*: 2-3 hours of dedicated leisure time (Socializing, Horseshoes, TV).
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** if Recreation is ignored for 2+ days.
4.  **Beauty**: Living in a dump is depressing.
    *   *Requirement*: Clean rooms, art, paved floors.
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** after spending a designated Scene in an "Ugly" environment (blood, vomit, dirt).
5.  **Comfort**: Sleeping on the floor hurts.
    *   *Requirement*: Chairs, beds, temperature control.
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** after sleeping on the ground or in extreme heat/cold.

### Stress & Mental Breaks
Stress is the silent killer. As unmet needs pile up, the mind begins to fracture.

#### Gaining Stress
*   **Unmet Needs**: See above.
*   **Pushing a Roll**: +1 Stress (voluntary effort).
*   **Witnessing Death**: +1 Stress.
*   **Pain**: +1 Stress per day if suffering from Untended Wounds or Painful Scars.

#### The Stress Die
For every point of accumulated Stress, add **1d6** to your dice pool for ALL rolls.
*   **The Benefit**: The d6 result adds to your total (helping you hit Tier 2/3). Stress focuses the mind... briefly.
*   **The Risk**: If you roll a **1** on *any* Stress Die, you trigger a **Panic Check**.

#### Panic Check (Mental Break)
When a Panic Check is triggered, roll `1d6 + Current Stress`. Consult the table below.

| Result | Break Type | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-6** | **Anxious** | **Trembling**: -2 to all Dexterity/Shooting rolls for 1 hour. |
| **7-9** | **Minor Break** | **Hide within Room**: Character refuses to act for 1d4 hours. |
| **10-12** | **Major Break** | **Sad Wander**: Character walks towards danger or away from the colony, ignoring commands. |
| **13+** | **Extreme Break** | **Berserk**: Character attacks nearest creature (friend or foe) for 1d6 rounds. |

**Relieving Stress**:
Stress resets to 0 after:
*   A full night's sleep in a decent (Excellent+) bed.
*   A "Catharsis" event (completing a Mental Break).
*   Specific Recreation activities (e.g., specific drugs, social parties).

## Part 2: Combat

When diplomacy fails, the Rim demands violence. Combat is dangerous, bloody, and often fatal.

### The Combat Sequence
Combat uses a **Dynamic Turn System**.
1.  **Initiative**: Players roll **1d10** (Group Check).
    *   **6-10**: Players act first.
    *   **1-5**: Enemies act first.
2.  **Turns**: Alternate between sides (Player -> Enemy -> Player -> Enemy).
3.  **Round**: Ends when all combatants have acted.

> **Example: Initiative**
> **John**: "The raiders burst through the door! Roll for Initiative."
> **Mary**: "Okay, rolling a d10." *(Rolls a 7)*. "I got a 7!"
> **John**: "That's between 6 and 10. The Players go first. Viper acts before the raiders."

### The Action Economy (4 AP)
On your turn, spend **4 Action Points (AP)**.

| Action | Cost | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Move** | 1 AP | Move up to Speed (Default 6 squares/hexes). |
| **Attack** | 2 AP | Make a Shooting or Melee attack. |
| **Aim** | 1 AP | Gain **Augmented** (+1d10, drop lowest) on next attack. |
| **Take Cover** | 1 AP | Impose **Bane** on incoming attacks. |
| **Aid** | 1 AP | Give **Edge** (+2 next roll) to an ally. |
| **Use Item** | 1 AP | Drink potion, reload, switch weapon. |

### Common Combos
*   **The Skirmisher**: Move (1) + Attack (2) + Take Cover (1).
*   **The Turret**: Attack (2) + Attack (2).
*   **The Sprinter**: Move (1) + Move (1) + Move (1) + Move (1).
*   **The Sniper**: Aim (1) + Attack (2) + Move (1).

> **Example: Spending AP**
> **Mary**: "Viper has 4 AP. She's currently exposed, so I want to get to safety."
> **Mary**: "I'll spend **1 AP** to Move behind the sandbags. Then I'll spend **1 AP** to Aim at the leader."
> **Mary**: "I have 2 AP left, so I'll spend **2 AP** to Attack with my rifle."

### Attack Resolution
Attacks always hit; the quality determines the damage.
**Roll**: `2d10 + Attribute + Skill`

*   **Shooting**: Uses Dexterity.
*   **Melee**: Uses Vigor.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Weak Hit** | Deal **Half Damage**. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Solid Hit** | Deal **Full Damage**. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Critical Hit** | Deal **Double Damage** & Roll **Major Injury**. |

> **Example: Attack Roll**
> **John**: "You're Aiming, so you have **Augmented** on this shot. Roll 3d10 and keep the highest two."
> **Mary**: "My Dexterity is 0 and Shooting is +1 (10 points). So I add +1 to the roll."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 4, 8, 9)* "I keep 8 and 9. That's 17 + 1 = 18."
> **John**: "18 is a **Tier 3: Critical Hit**! You hit him right in the head."

### Damage & Armor
> **Damage = (Weapon Dmg x Tier Multiplier) - Armor Rating**

*   **HP**: Max HP = `10 + (Vigor x 2)`.
*   **Downed**: At 0 HP, character is unconscious and bleeds out in `Vigor` hours unless tended.

> **Example: Dealing Damage**
> **John**: "Your Rifle does 6 Damage. Since it's a Tier 3 hit, you deal **Double Damage** (12)."
> **John**: "The Raider is wearing a Flak Vest (Armor 3). So, 12 - 3 = **9 Damage** to his HP."

### Major Injuries & Body Parts
If a **Tier 3 Critical Hit** occurs (or specific traps/events), roll **1d6** for the Injury.

| d6 | Injury | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-3** | **Bleeding** | Take **1 Damage/turn** until tended. |
| **4** | **Broken Bone** | **Impaired** on physical actions. Speed halved. |
| **5** | **Concussion** | **Impaired** on mental actions. Skills disabled. |
| **6** | **Severed Part** | Loses a limb. Roll d4: (1) Hand, (2) Arm, (3) Foot, (4) Leg. |

> **Example: Critical Effect**
> **John**: "Since it was a Critical Hit, roll 1d6 for a Major Injury."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls a 6)* "A 6! What does that do?"
> **John**: "**Severed / Lethal**. You blew his head off. He's down immediately."

#### Body Part Banes (Permanent)
Losing parts imposes permanent penalties until replaced (Prosthetics/Bionics).

*   **Missing Hand**: **+1 Bane** to Shooting, Melee, Crafting, Medicine. Cannot dual-wield.
*   **Missing Arm**: **+2 Bane** to above. Cannot use two-handed items (Rifles, Greatswords).
*   **Missing Foot**: **+1 Bane** to Movement rolls. **-1 Speed**.
*   **Missing Leg**: **+2 Bane** to Movement rolls. **-2 Speed**. Cannot Sprint.
*   **Missing Eye**: **+1 Bane** to Shooting and Perception.
*   **Missing Ear**: **+1 Bane** to Social (Hard of hearing) and Awareness.

### Death & Downed
*   **0 HP**: You are **Downed**. You are unconscious and helpless.
*   **Death**: If you take damage while Downed, or if you are not tended within **1 hour**, you die.

## Part 3: Expeditions (Caravans)

Leaving the safety of your map tile is necessary for trade and raiding.

### Travel Speed
Movement is measured in **Hexes per Day**.
*   **Base Speed**: 1 Hex/Day.
*   **Modifiers**:
    *   **+1**: All colonists have mounts (Horses, Muffalos).
    *   **+1**: Traveling on Roads.
    *   **-1**: Difficult Terrain (Mountains, Swamp) or Winter.

### Foraging & Rations
Each day of travel requires food.
1.  **Rations**: Consume 2 Meals per person.
2.  **Foraging**: If no rations, make a **Plants** check (Difficulty 12).
    *   *Success*: Find fully sufficient wild food.
    *   *Failure*: Everyone gains **+1 Stress** and Starvation begins.

### Ambushes
The Rim is not empty. For every 3 hexes traveled, the GM (Storyteller) rolls for an event.
*   **Stealth Check**: Players can roll **Intellectual** (Scanning) or **Animals** (Scouting) to detect threats early.
    *   *Success*: You spot the ambush. You determine the engagement distance or evade.
    *   *Failure*: You are ambushed. Enemies start with Initiative and Cover.

### Carrying Capacity
*   Colonists carry personal gear.
*   **Pack Animals** (Muffalo, Alpaca) are required for heavy trade goods (Statues, vast amounts of Steel).
*   *Overburdened*: If carrying too much, Base Speed becomes **0.5 Hexes/Day**.
