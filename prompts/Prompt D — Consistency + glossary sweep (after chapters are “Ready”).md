Do a consistency sweep across chapters/:
- unify terminology and capitalization to match STYLE_GUIDE.md glossary
- detect duplicate or conflicting rules
- ensure character creation references are consistent across chapters
- produce GLOSSARY.md (or a glossary chapter) with canonical definitions

Make changes as small diffs; avoid large rewrites.
Rebuild the rulebook and report success.
