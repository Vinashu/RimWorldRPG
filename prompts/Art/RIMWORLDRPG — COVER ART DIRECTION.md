# 🚀 RIMWORLDRPG — COVER ART DIRECTION

---

# 1️⃣ The Job of Your Cover (clarity first)

Your cover must communicate:

**Genre**
→ Sci-fi frontier survival

**Tone**
→ Harsh world, but human warmth

**Play Experience**
→ Colony stories, drama, teamwork

If it looks like generic sci-fi or grimdark war, it fails.

# 2️⃣ Core Concept (Strong Direction)

## ⭐ Recommended Concept:

### *“New Colony, New Hope”*

A small group of colonists standing outside their freshly built base on an alien world.

Foreground:

* 2–3 core characters (Rurik, Mira, Jax or Tala)
* Relaxed but alert poses
* Tools/weapons visible but not combat-focused

Midground:

* Modular colony structures
* Solar panels, crops, antenna

Background:

* Alien sky
* Strange planet horizon
* One or two moons

Mood:
👉 Hopeful survival
👉 Frontier optimism
👉 Quiet tension

This instantly says:

> “We build stories here.”

# 3️⃣ Composition Formula (pro-level trick)

Use the **Triangle Composition**:

Top point:
⭐ Alien sky / planet / light source

Bottom left:
👤 Character 1

Bottom right:
👤 Character 2–3

Colony structures fill center.

This:
✔ feels stable
✔ frames title nicely
✔ guides the eye

---

# 4️⃣ Color Direction

## Palette

Muted frontier tones:

* Dusty orange
* Soft blue
* Desaturated green
* Warm sunlight accents

Avoid:
❌ Neon cyberpunk
❌ Dark gritty palettes
❌ Monochrome

Your book = survival, not dystopia.

---

# 5️⃣ Title Placement

Top third of cover:
RIMWORLDRPG (large, readable)

Subtitle optional:
“Frontier Colony Storytelling RPG”

Font feel:

* Clean sci-fi
* Slightly industrial
* Not overly futuristic

Think:

> Utilitarian sci-fi, not laser-punk.

---

# 6️⃣ What NOT to Show

Avoid:
❌ Big battle scenes
❌ Gore or violence focus
❌ Lone hero pose
❌ Spaceships dominating scene

Why?
Your game is about **colony stories**, not dogfights.

# 7️⃣ Cover Prompt Template (ready to use)

# 🧠 High-Level Insight (from Anne 😄)

Indie RPG covers that sell well usually show:

Your concept nails all three.

# ⭐ My Honest Recommendation

If you do only ONE premium piece of art in the whole project…

👉 Make it the cover.

It defines your entire IP.
