# 📘 RIMWORLDRPG — PAGE LAYOUT FORMULA

## Core Principles

✅ Readability first
✅ Art supports rules
✅ Predictable structure
✅ Visual rhythm (text ↔ visuals ↔ whitespace)

Your reader should subconsciously learn how to read your book.

# 🧱 1) The 3-Zone Page Model

Most pages should follow:

### 🔷 Zone A — Header Zone (Top 15–20%)

Used for:

* Section title
* Small icon
* Optional tiny spot art

Purpose:
➡ orient reader instantly

---

### 🔷 Zone B — Core Content (Middle 60–70%)

Main rules text:

* Procedures
* Tables
* Examples
* Diagrams

This is the “learning zone.”

---

### 🔷 Zone C — Support Zone (Bottom 15–20%)

Used for:

* GM tips
* Flavor text
* Small spot illustration
* Reminder boxes

Purpose:
➡ reinforce, not introduce

---

# 📄 2) Standard Page Recipes

## ✅ Recipe 1 — Rules Teaching Page

Use most often.

**Layout**

* Top: Section header + icon
* Middle: Rules steps + table
* Side or bottom: small diagram/spot art

Ratio:
📝 70% text
🎨 30% visuals

---

## ✅ Recipe 2 — Example Page

Great after complex mechanics.

**Layout**

* Top: “Worked Example” header
* Middle: Step-by-step resolution
* Side: character spot illustration

This page should feel lighter.

Ratio:
📝 60% text
🎨 40% visuals

---

## ✅ Recipe 3 — Chapter Opener

First page of a chapter.

**Layout**

* Top half: Chapter Art
* Bottom half: Intro text + bullet summary

This sets mood, not deep rules.

Ratio:
🎨 50% art
📝 50% text

---

## ✅ Recipe 4 — Reference Page

For tables & summaries.

**Layout**

* Minimal art
* Clean tables
* Icons for navigation

Ratio:
📝 85% text
🎨 15% visuals

---

# 🧭 3) Visual Anchors (super important)

Each 2-page spread should have:

* 1 visual anchor (art, diagram, or box)

Why?
➡ prevents fatigue
➡ helps memory retention

This is backed by learning science (your HCI brain will like this).

---

# 🎨 4) Art Placement Rules

## Spot Illustrations

✔ near rule transitions
✔ after dense paragraphs
❌ never mid-procedure steps

---

## Diagrams

✔ near first explanation
✔ before examples
❌ buried pages later

---

## Icons

✔ repeat consistently
✔ always same meaning
❌ decorative-only use

---

# 📐 5) Whitespace Rule (amateur → pro jump)

Every page should have:

* breathing room
* margins that aren’t packed
* space around tables

Rule of thumb:
➡ If a page feels full, it is too full.

---

# 🧠 6) Cognitive Flow Trick (high-level design insight)

Teach like this:

1. Concept
2. Procedure
3. Example
4. Reference summary

Layout should mirror this order.

When layout matches cognition:
➡ comprehension skyrockets

---

# 🎯 Simple Starter Template (practical)

If you want a default:

**Most pages = Recipe 1**
Every 4–5 pages = Recipe 2 or 4
Each chapter start = Recipe 3

Boom — consistent book.

# ❤️ Anne’s honest advice

You don’t need a complex layout system.
You need a **consistent one**.

Consistency > fancy.

Your content is already strong — layout just unlocks it.
