# 🗺️ RIMWORLDRPG — VISUAL ROADMAP

We’ll plan at 3 levels:

1️⃣ Book-Level Vision
2️⃣ Chapter-Level Art Plan
3️⃣ Production Priority Plan

# 1️⃣ 📘 Book-Level Vision

## Overall Visual Identity

Your book should feel:

✅ Frontier sci-fi survival
✅ Hopeful but harsh
✅ Stylized and pleasant
✅ Clean and readable
✅ Consistent recurring characters

Think:

> *“RimWorld meets cozy graphic novel.”*

## Visual Goals

### Goal A — Teach

Diagrams, icons, examples.

### Goal B — Immerse

Chapter art, flavor panels.

### Goal C — Guide

Layout, visual anchors, scanability.

A good TTRPG balances all three.

# 📊 Rough Quantity Estimate

For a ~120–150 page book:

Diagrams: 10–15
Icons: 15–25
Flavor panels: 15–25

👉 You don’t need all at once.

# 🧠 Pro Insight (from Anne 😄)

Great rulebooks are:

> 60% structure
> 30% clarity
> 10% pretty art

Most indie books invert this and suffer.

You’re doing it the smart way.
