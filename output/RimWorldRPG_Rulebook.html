## Welcome to the Rim

You are stranded. You are lightyears from the glitterworlds, on a lawless frontier planet known as a **Rimworld**. There is no government here, no safety net, and no faster-than-light travel to take you home.

### What is this Game?
This is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG), a conversation between friends where you build a story together.

*   **The Storyteller (ST)**: The host of the game. They describe the world, play the enemies (Raiders, Mechanoids), and control the flow of the story. They are not your enemy; they are the director of the drama.
*   **The Players**: You. You each control a **Colonist** (your character). You make decisions, roll dice, and try to keep your colony alive.

### The Rim Experience
In this game, you will tell the story of your colony's struggle and triumph.
*   **Build**: You will construct a base from scratch—bedrooms, freezers, killboxes, and hospitals.
*   **Survive**: You will manage starvation, disease, and mental breaks.
*   **Defend**: You will fight off raids from savage Tribals, high-tech Pirates, swarming Insects, and cold Mechanoids.
*   **Explore**: You will form caravans to trade with neighbors, complete quests, and raid enemy outposts.
*   **Escape**: Your ultimate goal is to survive long enough to build a ship and leave this cursed planet... or die trying.

---

## The Core Mechanic: The Story Die System

When a Colonist attempts an action with an uncertain outcome—shooting a raider, performing surgery, or negotiating a trade—you make a **Colonist Roll**.

### The Dice
You roll **two 10-sided dice (2d10)**.
1.  **The Base Die** (Any color, e.g., White): Represents your raw effort.
2.  **The Story Die** (Red): Represents the chaotic nature of the Rim.

**The Formula:**
> **Result = Base Die + Story Die + Attribute + Skill Modifier**
> 
*Skill Modifier = Floor(Skill Points / 10)*

### Tiers of Success
The total Result determines what happens. We don't use a binary Pass/Fail. **You almost always succeed, but at what cost?**

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You hit the raider but deal half damage. You bandage the wound but use 2x Medicine. You make the deal but pay 20% more. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal exactly as intended. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You achieve your goal with style. You deal double damage, heal instantly, or get a discount. |

### Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.
*   **Edge (+2)**: You have a minor advantage, like high ground or a good tool.
*   **Bane (-2)**: You have a minor disadvantage, like darkness or pain.
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The same in the other way around.
*   **Augmented (3d10)**: You have a major advantage (bionics, drugs, perfect position). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Highest**. Replaces standard roll (Edge/Bane do not apply).
*   **Impaired (3d10)**: You have a major disadvantage (blindness, toxicity, suppression). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Lowest**. Replaces standard roll (Edge/Bane do not apply).

*Note: Edge/Bane are additive. Augmented/Impaired replace the standard roll.*

*Note: The result of the Story Die is **always** applied, even if its value is discarded in an Augmented or Impaired roll.*

### Pushing Your Luck
Life on the Rim is desperate. You can push yourself beyond your limits.
*   **The Push**: You can voluntarily add **+1d6** to your roll.
*   **The Risk**: If the **d6** rolls a **1**, you trigger a **Panic Check** immediately after the action (regardless of success or failure). 

---

## The Story Die Effects

The Red Die (Story Die) adds narrative twists beyond simple numbers.

### Rolling a 1: Twist of Fate
If the Story Die shows a **1**, something unexpected but positive happens.
*   **Effect**: You gain **1 Inspiration Point** OR you gain an **Edge** on your next roll.
*   *Narrative*: You struggled to build the wall (Tier 1), but you found a better way to lay the bricks for next time.
*   *Narrative*: Your shot hit the enemy armour (Tier 1), but you were able to spot a weakness in their armor.

### Rolling a 10: Complication
If the Story Die shows a **10**, something dangerous happens.
*   **Effect**: You suffer a **Bane** on your next roll, or it will affect your stress level or mood.
*   *Narrative*: You shot the mechanoid perfectly (Tier 3), but your barrel overheated. Your next shot will be harder.
*   *Narrative*: You work harder to finish a section of the wall (Tier 3), but you are too tired and feel stressed.

### Inspiration Points
You can spend an Inspiration Point to:
*   **Reroll one die** in a future roll.
*   **Add +1d6** to a future roll.
*   **Avoid a Mental Break** (reduce Stress by 1d4).
*  **Give an edge**: to a colonist.
*  **Give a bane**: to a enemy.

## Time & Scale

Time on the Rim is tracked in specific units to manage survival.

### The Day
A standard day has 24 hours, divided into **Action Slots** for Base Building:
1.  **Morning** (5 hours)
2.  **Afternoon** (5 hours)
3.  **Evening** (5 hours)
4.  **Night** (8 hours - Sleep/Rest)
*The remaining hour is for meals and transitions.*

### The Quadrum
A year is divided into 4 seasons called **Quadrums**, each lasting **15 Days**.
1.  **Aprimay** (Early Spring)
2.  **Jugust** (Late Summer)
3.  **Septober** (Early Autumn)
4.  **Decembary** (Late Winter)

### Combat Movement (Range Bands)
Combat uses abstract **Range Bands** to track positioning, focusing on narrative flow rather than grid counting.

#### The 4 Bands
1.  **Melee**: Hand-to-hand combat. You are engaged with the enemy.
2.  **Close**: Short range. Shotguns, pistols, and grenades shine here.
3.  **Medium**: Standard combat range. Assault rifles and LMGs are optimal.
4.  **Far**: Long range. Sniper rifles and artillery.

#### Tactical Actions
*   **Move**: Shift **one band** closer or further (e.g., Medium → Close).
*   **Rush**: Sprint to shift **two bands**, but it costs two action ponts.
*   **Engage**: Moving into **Melee** locks you in combat. You cannot move away without **Disengaging** (1 action points) or risking a free attack.
*   **Take Cover**: You can assume a position behind cover within your band.
    *   **Light Cover** (Sandbags): Grants **Edge** to defense.
    *   **Heavy Cover** (Walls): Grants **Double Edge** to defense.

#### Weapon Range
Weapons have an **Optimal Band**. Using them outside this band (e.g., Sniping from Close range) applies a **Bane**.

### Caravan Movement (World Map)
*   **Scale**: 1 Hex = Approx. 1 Day of travel.
*   **Terrain**: Roads increase speed; Mountains and Swamps reduce it.



# Chapter 2: Character Creation

In RimWorld, no one is a blank slate. Every colonist has a history—a childhood on a glitterworld, a career as a space marine, or a dark past as a pirate.

We use a **Lifepath System** to generate your Colonist. You will roll for your background, survive terms of service, and emerge as a scarred but capable survivor.

> **Example: The Table**
>
> John and Mary are ready to start playing. John will act as the Storyteller (ST), and Mary will be a Player (Colonist).

---

## Step 1: Attributes
Every Colonist starts with the following array. Assign these numbers to your 4 Attributes:
> **+2, +1, +0, -1**

*   **Vigor**: Physical power and endurance.
*   **Dexterity**: Precision and speed.
*   **Mind**: Intellect and analysis.
*   **Spirit**: Empathy and willpower.

> **Example: Choosing Attributes**
>
> **John**: "Mary, you need to assign values to your four attributes using this array: +2, +1, 0, -1. Think about what your character is good at."
>
> **Mary**: "I want to create a female colonist. She will be very smart, so I'll put the **+2 in Mind**. She's wise and determined, so **+1 in Spirit**. She likes physical activities but isn't a soldier, so **0 in Dexterity** and **-1 in Vigor**."

---

## Step 2: Childhood
Your early years define your potential. Choose or Roll (1d10) for your Childhood Backstory.
*   **Skill Points**: You gain raw points (0-30).
*   **Modifier**: Your Skill Modifier is \`Floor(Skill Points / 10)\`.
    *   *Example*: 15 Points = +1 Modifier. 20 Points = +2 Modifier.

| d10 | Backstory | Skill Points | Trait |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Urchin** | +10 Melee, +10 Social | **Scrapper**: Ignore the first Bane in melee combat. |
| 2 | **Vatgrown** | +1 Vigor (Attr), +10 Shooting | **Dull**: +1 Bane to Social rolls, but +10 Mood. |
| 3 | **Noble Scion** | +1 Spirit (Attr), +10 Social | **Greedy**: Stress penalty if owning fewer/worse items than allies. |
| 4 | **Midworld Student** | +1 Mind (Attr), +10 Intellectual | **Fast Learner**: +1 XP gain per session. |
| 5 | **Feral Child** | +10 Animals, +10 Plants | **Wild**: Cannot do Intellectual tasks. |
| 6 | **War Refugee** | +10 Shooting, +10 Medical | **Pessimist**: -5 Mood permanently. |
| 7 | **Caveworld Tender** | +10 Mining, +10 Plants | **Undergrounder**: Immune to "Cabin Fever". Recover Stress indoors. -1 Mood/Day if outdoors > 8h. |
| 8 | **Industrial Orphan** | +10 Crafting, +10 Construction | **Industrious**: +1 Edge to all Construction rolls. |
| 9 | **Sheriff** | +10 Shooting, +10 Melee | **Trigger-Happy**: +1 Bane on Attack actions, but +1 Action per turn. |
| 10 | **Pop Idol** | +20 Social | **Beautiful**: +1 Edge to all Social interactions. |

> **Example: Childhood**
>
> **John**: "Okay, now we need to know where she came from. You can choose or roll for a Childhood."
>
> **Mary**: "I'll let the dice decide." *(Rolls a 6)*. "Oh, nice! I'm a **War Refugee**. That fits. She had to be smart to survive the war."
> **John**: "Perfect. That gives you **+10 Shooting** and **+10 Medical**, and the **Pessimist** trait."

---

## Step 3: Adulthood (The Terms)
You serve **Terms** of 4 years. You must take at least **1 Term**, and can take up to **4**.
*   **Age**: Start at 14 + (4 x Terms).
*   **Skill Cap**: You cannot start with more than **30 Points** (+3) in any skill.

**For each Term:**
1.  **Choose a Career**.
2.  **Roll Survival (1d10 + Attribute)** vs DC 12.
    *   *Success*: You survive unscathed, gain the career title.
    *   *Failure*: You gain a **Scar** or **Addiction** (see Effects below), but you still complete the term.
    *   **Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: You barely survive. Gain a **Random Negative Trait** (Roll on Table B).
3.  **Gain Skills**: Chose 2 skills from your career and add 5 skill points to each. If increasing a skill would push it above the **30 Point** cap, you must allocate the excess points to any other skill listed in your current Career.
4.  **Roll Event (1d10)**: Each career has a 10-line table. When you hit an entry, resolve the **first outcome** listed. If you roll that same entry again in a later term, take the **second outcome**, then the third, then the fourth—no duplicate re-rolls needed.
    *   **Critical Success (Natural 10)**: You have a life-changing moment. Gain a **Random Positive Trait** (Roll on Table A) in addition to the Event result.

> **Example: First Term**
>
> **John**: "Now, let's see how she fares in her first term."
>
> **Mary**: "For her first term, she tried to find peace. I'll choose the **Drifter** career."
>
> **John**: "Roll for Survival. You need a 12 using Dexterity."
>
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 2d10 + 0)* "I got a 14! She survived."
>
> **John**: "Great. Now pick two skills and roll for an event."
>
> **Mary**: "I'll take **Social** and **Plants**. For the event..." *(Rolls a 10)* "Found Treasure! I start with a Masterwork item."

## Step 4: Personality
After completing your terms, you must determine your final personality quirks.
**Roll 1d100** on **Table A (Positive)** and **Roll 1d100** on **Table B (Negative)**. You gain both traits.

*   **Ascetic**: Recover **1 Stress/Day** when eating Raw Food or sleeping on ground. **+1 Bane** if using Luxury items.

>
> **Mary**: "Yes! That's perfect. She prefers the darkness."

## Step 6: Arrival Scenario
How did you get here? (Group Decision).

1.  **Crashlanded** (Standard):
    *   **Tech Level: Industrial 2**. Good tech, some food.
    *   **Equipment**: Bolt-action Rifle, Revolver, Plasteel Knife, Flak Vest, 30 Packaged Meals, Medkit (x3).

# Chapter 3: Skills & Checks

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, you roll the dice.

---

## The Core Mechanic
To resolve any challenge, roll **2d10** and add your relevant **Attribute** and **Skill Modifier**.

> **Result = 2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**

*Reminders from Chapter 1:*
*   You always roll **two d10s**: one **Base Die** and one **Red Story Die**.
*   The **Total** determines your Tier.
*   The **Face** on the Story Die may trigger special effects (Twists or Complications).

We do not use a "Pass/Fail" Difficulty Class. Instead, your Result determines the **Tier of Success**:

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You achieve your goal, but things get messy. You are spotted, you take damage, or it costs extra resources. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal cleanly and effectively. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You win. Double damage, half time, or extra benefits. |

> **Example: Negotiating**
>
> **John**: "Viper is trying to negotiate a lower price for the medicine."
>
> **Mary**: "Okay, Viper has **Spirit +1** and **Social 25 (+2)**. So I add +3 to my roll."
>
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 2d10)* "I got a 6 and a 7. Total is 13 + 3 = 16."
>
> **John**: "That's a **Tier 2 Success**. The trader agrees to your price without complaint."

### Where is the Difficulty?
There are no "DCs" to beat. Difficulty is handled through **Modifiers** and **Narrative Consequences**.
*   **Easy Task**: The Storyteller might rule it succeeds automatically, or grant an **Edge (+2)**.
*   **Hard Task**: The Storyteller will apply a **Bane (-2)**, or warn that a Tier 1 result will have severe consequences.

### Skill Modifiers
Your **Skill Points** (0-30) determine your modifier for the roll.
*   **0-9 Points**: +0
*   **10-19 Points**: +1
*   **20-29 Points**: +2
*   **30 Points**: +3 (Master)

---

## Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.

### Minor Modifiers (+2 / -2)
*   **Edge (+2)**: Minor advantage (High ground, good tools).
*   **Bane (-2)**: Minor disadvantage (Darkness, poor tools).

> **Example: Edge & Bane**
>
> **John**: "You're shooting at the raider, but it's dark (**Bane**). However, you have a high-quality scope (**Edge**)."
>
> **Mary**: "So the Edge and Bane cancel out?"
>
> **John**: "Exactly. Just roll straight. 2d10 + Dexterity + Shooting."

### Double Modifiers
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.

> **Example: Double Edge**
>
> **John**: "You have the high ground (**Edge**) AND the raider is out in the open (**Edge**). That's **Double Edge**."
>
> **Mary**: "So if I succeed, the result is upgraded?"
>
> **John**: "Yes. A **Tier 2 (Success)** becomes a **Tier 3 (Triumph)**. A **Tier 1 (Struggle)** becomes a **Tier 2 (Success)**."

### Cancel Modifiers
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The reverse also applies.

### Major Modifiers (3d10)
*   **Augmented**: Major advantage (Bionics, drugs, perfect position). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Highest**.
*   **Impaired**: Major disadvantage (Blindness, toxicity, suppression). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Lowest**.

> **Example: Augmented**
>
> **John**: "Viper has a bionic eye targeting system. That counts as **Augmented** for this shot."
>
> **Mary**: "Okay, I roll **3d10** and keep the highest two."
>
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 3, 8, 9)* "I keep the 8 and 9. Total 17 + Modifiers."

*Note: You can not have both Edge and Augmented on the same roll.*

*Note: The result of the Story Die is **always** applied, even if its value is discarded in an Augmented or Impaired roll.*

---

## Pushing Your Luck
Life on the Rim is desperate. You can push yourself beyond your limits.
*   **The Push**: You can voluntarily gain **+1 Stress** to add **+1d6** to your roll.
*   **The Risk**: If the **d6** rolls a **1**, you trigger a **Panic Check** immediately after the action (regardless of success or failure).

> **Example: The Push**
>
> **Mary**: "I rolled an 11 (Tier 1)... I really need a clean success to fix the generator! Can I push it?"
>
> **John**: "You can. Add **1d6** to the total to try and hit 12+, but if you roll a **1** on that die, you panic."
>
> **Mary**: "I have to try. Come on..." *(Rolls d6)* "I got a 4! Total is 15. Tier 2 Success!"
>
> **John**: "You wipe the sweat from your brow. The generator hums to life."

# Chapter 4: Survival & Combat

Life on the Rim is a constant struggle against hunger, madness, and violent death. This chapter covers the rules for keeping your colonists alive—both physically and mentally.

---

## Part 1: Survival & Needs

Your colonists are not just stats on a page; they are people with needs. Ignoring these needs leads to **Stress**, and eventually, **Mental Breaks**.

### The 5 Core Needs
1.  **Food**: Colonists must eat every day.
    *   *Requirement*: 2 Meals per day.
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** per missed meal. After 3 days, start taking **1d10 Damage** per day (Starvation).
2.  **Rest**: Colonists must sleep.
    *   *Requirement*: 8 hours of sleep (Nightowl trait reduces this to 4 hours of sleep).
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** per night of poor/missed sleep. Become **Fatigued** (-2 to all pools).
3.  **Recreation**: "All work and no play makes a dull boy."
    *   *Requirement*: 4 hours of dedicated leisure time (Socializing, Horseshoes, TV). Two or more Colonists working on the same daily activity in the same period of time are considered socializing.
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** if Recreation is ignored for 2+ days.
4.  **Beauty**: Living in a dump is depressing.
    *   *Requirement*: Clean rooms, art, paved floors.
    **Penalty**: Gain **+1 Stress** if spending more than 4 hours in an "Ugly" environment.
5.  **Comfort**: Sleeping on the floor hurts.
    **Requirement**: Chairs, beds, temperature control (see Chapter 6).
    *   *Penalty*: Gain **+1 Stress** after sleeping on the ground or in extreme heat/cold.

### Stress & Mental Breaks
Stress is the silent killer. As unmet needs pile up, the mind begins to fracture.

#### Gaining Stress
*   **Unmet Needs**: See above.
*   **Pushing a Roll**: +1 Stress (voluntary effort).
*   **Witnessing Death**: +1 Stress (Stranger/Enemy), +3 Stress (Colonist/Bonded Animal).
*   **Pain**: +1 Stress per day if suffering from Untended Wounds or Painful Scars.

#### The Stress Die
*   **The Benefit**: The d6 result adds to your total (helping you hit Tier 2/3). Stress focuses the mind... briefly.
*   **The Risk**: If you roll a **1** on *any* Stress Die, you trigger a **Panic Check**.

#### Panic Check (Mental Break)
When a Panic Check is triggered, roll \`1d6 + Current Stress\`. Consult the table below.

| Result | Break Type | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-6** | **Anxious** | **Trembling**: -2 to all Dexterity/Shooting rolls for 1 hour. |
| **7-9** | **Minor Break** | **Binge**: Character consumes 3x Meals or Drugs immediately. |
| **10-12** | **Major Break** | **Tantrum**: Character attacks a random colony structure/item (it loses 10 CP). |
| **13+** | **Extreme Break** | **Insulting Spree**: Character verbally abuses allies. Gain **+1 Stress** for every ally. |

**Relieving Stress**:
Stress resets to 0 or reduces via:
*   **Luxury Meal**: Consuming a Lavish Meal removes **2 Stress**.
*   **Relaxing Socially**: Successful Social check (Tier 2) removes **1 Stress**.
*   **Catharsis**: Completing a Mental Break rests Stress to 0.
*   **Sleep**: A full night's sleep in an Excellent+ bed removes **All Stress**.

---

## Part 2: Combat

When diplomacy fails, the Rim demands violence. Combat is dangerous, bloody, and often fatal.

### The Combat Sequence
Combat uses a **Dynamic Turn System**.
1.  **Initiative**: Players roll **1d10** (Group Check).
    *   **6-10**: Players act first.
    *   **1-5**: Enemies act first.
2.  **Turns**: Alternate between sides (Player -> Enemy -> Player -> Enemy).
3.  **Round**: Ends when all combatants have acted.

> **Example: Initiative**
>
> **John**: "The raiders burst through the door! Roll for Initiative."
>
> **Mary**: "Okay, rolling a d10." *(Rolls a 7)*. "I got a 7!"
>
> **John**: "That's between 6 and 10. The Players go first. Viper acts before the raiders."

### The Action Economy (4 AP)
On your turn, spend **4 Action Points (AP)**. You can split these actions however you like.

| Action | Cost | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Move** | 1 AP | Shift **One Range Band** (e.g. Medium -> Close). |
| **Rush** | 2 AP | Shift **Two Range Bands** (e.g. Far -> Close). |
| **Attack** | 2 AP | Make a Shooting or Melee attack. |
| **Aim** | 1 AP | Gain **Augmented** (+1d10, drop lowest) on next attack. |
| **Take Cover** | 1 AP | Gain Cover (Bane to attacker). |
| **Aid** | 1 AP | Give **Edge** (+2 next roll) to an ally. |
| **Use Item** | 1 AP | Drink potion, reload, switch weapon. |

### Common Combos
*   **The Skirmisher**: Move (1) + Attack (2) + Take Cover (1).
*   **The Turret**: Attack (2) + Attack (2).
*   **The Sprinter**: Rush (2) + Move (1) + Take Cover (1).
*   **The Sniper**: Aim (1) + Attack (2) + Take Cover (1).

> **Example: Spending AP**
>
> **Mary**: "Viper has 4 AP. She's currently exposed, so I want to get to safety."
>
> **Mary**: "I'll spend **1 AP** to Move behind the sandbags. Then I'll spend **1 AP** to Aim at the leader."
>
> **Mary**: "I have 2 AP left, so I'll spend **2 AP** to Attack with my rifle."

### Attack Resolution
Attacks always hit; the quality determines the damage.
**Roll**: \`2d10 + Attribute + Skill\`

*   **Shooting**: Uses Dexterity.
*   **Melee**: Uses Vigor.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Weak Hit** | Deal **Half Damage**. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2: Solid Hit** | Deal **Full Damage**. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Critical Hit** | Deal **Double Damage** & Roll **Major Injury**. |

> **Example: Attack Roll**
>
> **John**: "You're Aiming, so you have **Augmented** on this shot. Roll 3d10 and keep the highest two."
>
> **Mary**: "My Dexterity is 0 and Shooting is +1 (10 points). So I add +1 to the roll."
>
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 4, 8, 9)* "I keep 8 and 9. That's 17 + 1 = 18."
>
> **John**: "18 is a **Tier 3: Critical Hit**! You hit him right in the head."

### Damage & Armor
> **Damage = (Weapon Dmg x Tier Multiplier) - Armor Rating**

*   **HP**: Max HP = \`15 + (Vigor x 2)\`.
*   **Downed**: At 0 HP, character is unconscious and bleeds out in \`Vigor\` hours unless tended.

> **Example: Dealing Damage**
>
> **John**: "Your Rifle does 6 Damage. Since it's a Tier 3 hit, you deal **Double Damage** (12)."
>
> **John**: "The Raider is wearing a Flak Vest (Armor 3). So, 12 - 3 = **9 Damage** to his HP."

### Critical Effects & Conditions

## Part 3: Expeditions (Caravans)

Leaving the safety of your map tile is necessary for trade and raiding.

### Travel Speed
Movement is measured in **Hexes per Day**.
*   **Base Speed**: 1 Hex/Day.
*   **Modifiers**:
    *   **+1**: All colonists have mounts (Horses, Muffalos).
    *   **+1**: Traveling on Roads.
    *   **-1**: Difficult Terrain (Mountains, Swamp) or Winter.

### Foraging & Rations
Each day of travel requires food.
1.  **Rations**: Consume 2 Meals per person.
2.  **Foraging**: If no rations, make a **Plants** check (Difficulty 12).
    *   *Success*: Find fully sufficient wild food.
    *   *Tier 1 (Struggle)*: Everyone gains **+1 Stress** and Starvation begins.

### Ambushes
The Rim is not empty. For every 3 hexes traveled, the GM (Storyteller) rolls for an event.
*   **Stealth Check**: Players can roll **Intellectual** (Scanning) or **Animals** (Scouting) to detect threats early.
    *   *Success*: You spot the ambush. You determine the engagement distance or evade.
    *   *Tier 1 (Struggle)*: You are ambushed. Enemies start with Initiative and Cover.

### Carrying Capacity
*   Colonists carry personal gear.
*   **Pack Animals** (Muffalo, Alpaca) are required for heavy trade goods (Statues, vast amounts of Steel).
*   *Overburdened*: If carrying too much, Base Speed becomes **0.5 Hexes/Day**.


# Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy

Survival on the Rim requires the right tools. A sharp knife, a warm parka, and a pocket full of silver can make the difference between life and death.

---

## Economy
The universal currency of the Rim is **Silver**.
*   **Starting Wealth**: Determined by your Scenario (Chapter 2).
*   **Trade**: You can trade with visiting caravans or orbital trade ships (requires Comms Console).

### Market Value & Trading
**Market Value** is the base worth of an item, calculated roughly as:
> **Market Value = (Material Cost) + (Crafting Points × 0.5)**

When trading, prices are adjusted by the trader's **Social** skill:
*   **Base Buy Price**: 140% of Market Value.
*   **Base Sell Price**: 60% of Market Value.
*   **Social Bonus**: For every level of Social, improve prices by **2%**.
    *   *Example*: Social 10 gives +20% better prices (Buy at 120%, Sell at 80%).
    *   *Max Bonus*: ±40% (at Social 20).

> **Example: Trading**
>
> **John**: "The orbital trader offers to buy your sculptures. The base value is 500 Silver."
>
> **Mary**: "Viper does the talking. She has **Social 40 (+4)**."
>
> **John**: "Okay, the base sell price is 60% (300 Silver). With Social 40 (Level 4), you get +8%."
>
> **Mary**: "So 68%? That's 340 Silver."
>
> **John**: "Deal."

### Common Item Values

# Chapter 6: Colony Management

Building a thriving colony requires more than just survival; it requires industry, research, and expansion.

---

## Base Management

The Base is the heart of the game. It has its own stats and resources.

### Resources
We track 5 abstract resource categories:
1.  **Food**: Meals, pemmican, raw meat/veg.
2.  **Textile**: Leather, cloth, wool.
3.  **Ore**: Steel, plasteel, gold.
4.  **Components**: Machinery parts, electronics.
5.  **Medicine**: Herbal meds, glitterworld meds.

### Daily Actions
The day is divided into **4 Periods**: **Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night**.

**1. Planning Phase**: At the start of the day, each player decides what their character will do for each of the 4 periods. You can assign a specific task (Farming, Building, etc.) or choose to **Rest/Sleep**.

**2. Resolution Phase**: Once all plans are set, players make the necessary Skill Checks for each active period.

| Action | Roll | Tier 1 (11-) | Tier 2 (12-16) | Tier 3 (17+) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Farming** | **Mind + Plants** | **1 Food** | **2 Food, 1 Textile** | **4 Food, 2 Textile** |

> **Mary**: "Okay, here is my schedule:
> *   **Morning**: Hunting. We need meat.
> *   **Afternoon**: Building. I want to finish the sandbags.
> *   **Evening**: Researching. I'll put in some hours on Gunsmithing.
> *   **Night**: Sleeping."
>
> **John**: "Sounds like a busy day. Let's resolve the rolls."
> **Mary**: "First, **Hunting** (Dex + Shooting)... *(Rolls 14)*. Tier 2! **2 Food, 1 Textile**."
> **Mary**: "Next, **Building** (Vigor + Construction)... *(Rolls 18)*. Tier 3! **5 CP**. The sandbags are done!"
> **Mary**: "Finally, **Research** (Mind + Intellectual)... *(Rolls 9)*. Tier 1. Just **20 RP**."
> **John**: "A productive day. Viper collapses into bed, exhausted but satisfied."

---

## Construction & Infrastructure

Building structures requires **Materials** and **Construction Points (CP)**.
*   **Construction Speed**: A character generates CP equal to their **Construction Skill × 10** per hour.

> **Example: Building**
> **Mary**: "We need defenses. Viper spends the afternoon building sandbags."
> **John**: "Sandbags cost **10 CP**. Roll **Vigor + Construction**."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 18)*. "Tier 3! I generate **5 CP**."
> **John**: "You're halfway there. You'll need another slot to finish them."

### Structures
| Building | Materials | CP | Tech Req | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wall (Wood)** | 5 Wood | 10 | - | Flammable. |
| **Wall (Stone)** | 5 Stone Blocks | 20 | Medieval 1 | Durable. Fireproof. |

*   **Reduce damage** taken by a Colonist.
*   **Prevent damage** to a building.

### Cover Mechanics
*   **Partial Cover**: Attacker suffers **Bane**.
*   **Full Cover**: Attacker suffers **Double Bane**.

---

## Research & Technology

Knowledge is power. To craft advanced items or build complex structures, you must first unlock the technology level required.

### The Research Process
1.  **Assign a Researcher**: A character spends an **Action Slot (4 hours)** working at a **Research Bench**.
2.  **Make a Research Check**: \`Roll = 2d10 + Mind + Intellectual\`
3.  **Determine Outcome**:
    *   **Tier 1 (≤11)**: **20 RP**. Progress is slow.
    *   **Tier 2 (12-16)**: **50 RP**. Steady progress.
    *   **Tier 3 (17+)**: **100 RP**. A breakthrough!

> **Example: Researching**
> **Mary**: "Viper spends the evening at the research bench. We need **Gunsmithing** (Industrial 2)."
> **John**: "Okay, roll **Mind + Intellectual**. You're using a simple bench for Industrial tech, so no bonus."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 11)*. "Tier 1... only **20 RP**."
> **John**: "It's slow going. You're scratching your head over the blueprints."

### Tech Categories
*   **Neolithic (Levels 1-4)**: Basic survival. Cost: Level × 100 RP.
*   **Medieval (Levels 1-5)**: Metalworking, smithing. Cost: Level × 300 RP.
*   **Industrial (Levels 1-6)**: Electricity, firearms. Cost: Level × 600 RP.
*   **Spacer (Levels 1-7)**: Bionics, spaceflight. Cost: Level × 1000 RP.

# Chapter 8: The Storyteller (GM Section)

Welcome, Storyteller. You are the architect of chaos, the hand of fate, and the voice of the Rim itself. This chapter provides you with the tools to run engaging, challenging, and memorable RimWorld TTRPG sessions.

---

## Part 1: Running the Game

### Your Role as Storyteller
You are not the players' enemy—you are their **narrator** and **challenge designer**. Your job is to:
*   **Create Drama**: Introduce threats, opportunities, and moral dilemmas.
*   **Be Fair**: Don't fudge dice to kill characters, but don't pull punches either.
*   **Embrace Chaos**: RimWorld is about emergent stories. Let the dice and player choices drive the narrative.

### Pacing and Tone
RimWorld alternates between **quiet colony-building** and **explosive crises**.

**The Colony Phase** (Downtime):
*   Players assign colonists to tasks (farming, crafting, research).
*   Use this time for character development, social interactions, and planning.
*   Duration: 3-7 in-game days per session.

**The Crisis Phase** (Events):
*   Introduce threats: raids, disasters, or opportunities.
*   Keep combat fast and brutal.
*   Duration: 1-2 hours of real-time play.

**Balance**: Aim for a 60/40 split (60% colony-building, 40% crisis). Adjust based on player preference.

---

## Part 2: Storyteller Personas

Choose a Storyteller persona to guide your event pacing. You can switch personas between sessions or campaigns.

### Cassandra Classic
*   **Style**: Steady escalation. Predictable but relentless.
*   **Pacing**: Events occur every 4-6 days. Major threats scale with colony wealth.
*   **Best For**: New players who want a fair, balanced challenge.

**Event Frequency**:
*   **Days 1-10**: Minor events only.
*   **Days 11-30**: Mix of Minor and Major events.
*   **Days 31+**: All event types, weighted by wealth.

### Randy Random
*   **Style**: Pure chaos. Anything can happen at any time.
*   **Pacing**: Roll for an event every 2-3 days. Ignore wealth scaling.
*   **Best For**: Experienced players who want unpredictability.

**Event Frequency**:
*   Roll **1d6** every 2-3 days:
    *   **1-2**: Minor event.
    *   **3-4**: Major event.
    *   **5-6**: Extreme event (even on Day 1!).

### Phoebe Chillax
*   **Style**: Relaxed. Long breaks between threats.
*   **Pacing**: Events occur every 8-12 days. Gentle difficulty curve.
*   **Best For**: Players who want to focus on base-building and roleplay.

**Event Frequency**:
*   **Days 1-20**: Minor events only, infrequent.
*   **Days 21+**: Occasional Major events. Extreme events are rare.

---

*   **10 (Complication)**: Event is worse than expected (more enemies, longer duration).

---

## Part 5: Quests

Quests add variety and reward player initiative.

### Quest Types

**1. Rescue Mission**
*   **Setup**: Faction member is captured/injured nearby.
*   **Challenge**: Travel to location, fight captors, escort survivor back.
*   **Reward**: +15 Goodwill, potential recruit.

*   **Reward**: Advanced weapons, Components, or Psylink Neuroformer.

### Quest Frequency
Offer 1 quest every 10-15 days. Players can decline, but repeated refusals may lower Goodwill.

---

## Part 6: Wealth Management

Colony wealth determines threat level. As players accumulate resources, enemies grow stronger.

### Calculating Wealth
**Wealth** = (Buildings + Items + Colonists) in Silver value.
*   **Buildings**: 100 Silver per structure.
*   **Items**: Market Value (see Chapter 5).
*   **Colonists**: 1,500 Silver each.

### Threat Scaling
Use wealth to scale enemy strength:

| Wealth | Threat Level | Enemy Count | Enemy Quality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-2,000** | **Low** | 3-5 enemies | Tribal, weak gear. |
| **2,001-5,000** | **Medium** | 5-8 enemies | Pirates, basic guns. |
| **5,001-10,000** | **High** | 8-12 enemies | Mixed gear, some armor. |
| **10,001-20,000** | **Very High** | 12-18 enemies | Advanced weapons, Mechanoids. |
| **20,001+** | **Extreme** | 20+ enemies | Siege weapons, Centipedes, Elite Mercs. |

### Balancing Tips
*   **Don't Punish Success**: Wealth scaling should challenge, not punish. If players are struggling, reduce event frequency.
*   **Reward Preparation**: If players invest in defenses (turrets, walls), let those defenses work.
*   **Vary Threats**: Don't just send bigger raids. Use environmental disasters, infestations, and social challenges.

---

## Part 7: Final Advice

### Embrace Failure
RimWorld stories are best when things go wrong. A colonist's death, a failed defense, a mental break—these create drama. Don't save players from consequences, but give them tools to recover.

### Let Players Drive
If players want to focus on trading instead of combat, let them. If they want to raid pirates, support it. The best sessions emerge from player agency.

### Use the Story Die
The Story Die (1d10) is your secret weapon. It turns predictable events into memorable moments. A "1" on a raid roll might mean they're drunk and disorganized (Twist of Fate). A "10" might mean the raiders brought a Doomsday Rocket Launcher (Complication).

### Have Fun
You're not writing a novel—you're facilitating chaos. Laugh at disasters, celebrate victories, and remember: **every scar tells a story**.

*"The Rim is a harsh teacher. But those who survive? They become legends."*


# RIMWORLD RPG — QUICKSTART ONE-SHOT

## “The First Night on Greyhook Ridge”

**Session length:** 2.5–4 hours
**Players:** 3–5 + Storyteller
**Tone:** survival drama + sudden violence + messy heroics
**Core systems used:**

* Story Die (Twist / Complication)
* Tiers (Struggle / Success / Triumph)
* Edge/Bane + Augmented/Impaired
* Needs + Mood + Stress → Mental Break risk
* Combat (AP + cover)
* Equipment + Market Value (micro use)
* Colony Day Loop (4 periods)
* Research + Build/Harvest/Hunt (light)

---

## Page 1 — What You Need to Play

### The Premise

Your shuttle breaks apart over a frozen-forest Rimworld. You crash near **Greyhook Ridge** with almost nothing. The first day decides everything: **get shelter, food, and a basic defense before nightfall**.

You are not heroes.
You are colonists.

### The One-Sentence Goal

**Survive the first night and secure a defensible foothold** — or at least ensure someone is alive to bury the bodies.

### The Table Setup

* Each player takes a pregen colonist (below).
* The Storyteller runs the day loop and interrupts it with events.
* Keep scenes short and cinematic.

### Dice & Resolution

Players always roll **2d10** (one Base + one **red Story Die**) + Attribute + Skill.

**Tiers (default):**

* **11-** Struggle
* **12–16** Success
* **17+** Triumph

**Edge/Bane:**

* **Edge:** reroll either die once
* **Bane:** Storyteller rerolls one die that looks too good

**Story Die triggers:**

* **1 = Twist of Fate** (Inspiration/Edge/boon)
* **10 = Complication** (Bane/Stress/Mood hit/new danger)

> *Use this quickstart as the “tiers-first” version (no DC needed tonight).*

---

## Page 2 — The Day Loop (4 Periods)

**Each day has 4 periods:** Dawn, Midday, Dusk, Night.
Each colonist chooses **one major action per period**.
The Storyteller frames short scenes and advances needs/mood.

### Period Actions (use 1–2 rolls each)

* **Build Shelter** (Construction)
* **Gather Resources** (Mining/Plants)
* **Hunt** (Shooting/Animals)
* **Cook** (Cooking)
* **Treat Wounds** (Medicine)
* **Research Basics** (Intellectual)
* **Scout** (Reflex/Survival)
* **Social Support** (Social) — reduce Stress or restore Mood

### Needs & Mood (light version for quickstart)

At the end of each period, apply:

* If a Need is neglected, mark **-1 Mood**.
* If two or more Needs are neglected, mark **+1 Stress**.

**Trigger a Mental Break** if a colonist reaches **3 Stress** and rolls a **Complication (Story Die 10)**.

**Quick Mental Break table (d6):**
1–2 **Wander / Shut Down**
3–4 **Food Binge**
5 **Berserk**
6 **Sadistic / Destructive Outburst**

---

## Page 2 — The Crash Site

### The Map
![The Crash Site](../images/TheCrashSite.png)
A shallow valley beside **Greyhook Ridge**:

* **Treeline** to the west (cover + hunt)
* **Rock outcrop** to the north (good for a barricade)
* **Ruined shack** to the east (half-collapsed)
* **Stream** south (clean water if boiled)

### Starting Supplies

* 6 simple rations
* 1 bedroll per colonist
* Scrap metal (enough for 1 barricade or 1 simple room)
* 1 basic tool kit
* 1 ranged weapon total for the team + knives
  *(Let Sana start with the rifle if she’s in play.)*

### The First Choice (Dawn)

The group must decide:
**Repair the ruin** or **build a new lean-to** near the rocks.

Use a **group check** (Construction or Survival).

* **Struggle:** shelter is weak → **night defense is harder**
* **Success:** decent shelter
* **Triumph:** shelter + basic barricade

---

## Page 3 — Scripted Events (use 2 of 3)

You only need two major events to hit all systems.

### Event A — The Injured Wanderer (Midday)

A lone survivor stumbles in, bleeding and delirious.
They have a **pack of medicine + a pistol**.

**Choices:**

* Help them (Medicine + Social)
* Rob them (Melee/Social)
* Turn them away (Mood impact)

**Twist (Story Die 1):**
They reveal a **cache location** nearby.
**Complication (Story Die 10):**
They’re being tracked.

This scene comes with an easy opportunity to introduce **Social Support**, **Mood**, and **Ethics under pressure**.

---

### Event B — The Trader with Bad Timing (Dusk)

A small caravan arrives.
They’ll trade **ammo, a heater, or food**.

Run a quick **Market Value** moment:

* Social skill can improve deals.
* Players can trade scrap, rations, or favors.

**Twist:**
Trader offers a cheap turret blueprint.
**Complication:**
Trader accidentally leads danger to your camp.

This is your light introduction to **economy** and **colony tech stakes**.

---

### Event C — The Weather Knife (Any time)

A sudden cold snap and windstorm.

Mechanically:

* If shelter is weak → everyone gains **+1 Stress**
* Cooking / Rest actions are harder
* Hypothermia risk in the night fight

This supports **Needs/Mood/Stress** pressure.

---

## Page 3 — The Night Threat (Finale)

Pick one based on your table’s vibe:

### Option 1 — **Manhunter Pack**

A pack of 6–10 maddened wolves or feral dogs charges at night.
They target **the noisiest or weakest** colonist first.

**Play tips:**

* Emphasize **cover**, **kiting**, and **triage**
* Let a **Triumph** enable clever tactics (trap use, collapsing ruin, etc.)

### Option 2 — **Desperate Raiders**

2–4 poorly equipped raiders attack looking for supplies.
They attempt intimidation first.

Use:

* A short **Social showdown** before bullets
* Then **combat**

**Twist:**
One raider is barely a teenager.
**Complication:**
They set fire to your only shelter.

---

## Page 4 — Victory, Fallout, and Fast Debrief

### Win Conditions

The colony “wins” if, by morning:

* At least **two colonists alive**, and
* The group has **shelter + either food or basic defenses**.

### If They Barely Survive

That is the *correct* RimWorld vibe.
End with:

* A quiet sunrise
* A body being buried
* A promise of the next season

### Rewards (light campaign hook)

* Everyone gains **+10 Skill Points** in one used skill
* The colony gains **1 Research Point**
* The group chooses a **Storyteller mode** for next session
  (Cassandra / Phoebe / Randy)
