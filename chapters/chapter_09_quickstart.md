## Quickstart Rules (Simplified)

### Dice and Tiers

**When it applies**
Whenever a Colonist attempts an action with an uncertain outcome.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10** (one Base Die, one **red Story Die**).
2. Add the relevant **Attribute** and **Skill Modifier**.
3. Compare the total to the Tier table.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Struggle** | You succeed with a major cost. |
| **12–16** | **Success** | You succeed cleanly. |
| **17+** | **Triumph** | You succeed with extra benefits. |

Purpose: Quickstart roll flow and tier thresholds]

**Edge cases**
* Full rules are in [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md) and [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).

**Example: Dice and Tiers**
Sana rolls **2d10 + Dexterity + Shooting** and totals **15**. That is a **Success**.

---

### Edge and Bane (Quickstart Variant)

**When it applies**
When a circumstance gives a small advantage or disadvantage.

**How it works**
* **Edge**: Reroll **either die once** and keep the new result.
* **Bane**: The Storyteller rerolls **one die that looks too good**, and you must keep the new result.

**Edge cases**
* This quickstart version is different from the full rules (see Chapter 1).

**Example: Edge and Bane**
Viper has Edge for high ground. She rerolls her **Base Die 3** and gets a **7**, improving her total.

Purpose: Show the quickstart Edge/Bane reroll mechanic]

---

### Story Die Triggers

**When it applies**
After any roll that includes the red Story Die.

**How it works**
* **Story Die 1**: **Twist of Fate** (Inspiration, Edge, or a boon).
* **Story Die 10**: **Complication** (Bane, Stress, or a new danger).

**Example: Story Die**
Oren rolls a **10** on the Story Die. He succeeds, but the Storyteller introduces a Complication.

---

### Action Points and Range Bands

**When it applies**
During combat.

**How it works**
* Each Colonist has **4 AP** per turn.
* Range Bands are **Melee, Close, Medium, Far**.

| Action | AP | Effect |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Move** | 1 | Shift one band. |
| **Attack** | 2 | Make a ranged or melee attack. |
| **Take Cover** | 1 | Gain defensive Edge. |
| **Use Item** | 1 | Reload, switch, or heal. |

Purpose: Visual timeline of Dawn/Midday/Dusk/Night periods]

**Edge cases**
* Full combat rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Action Points**
Marla spends **1 AP** to Move to Close range, **1 AP** to Take Cover, and **2 AP** to Attack.

---

### Combat Damage

**When it applies**
After a successful attack roll.

**How it works**
* **Struggle**: Half damage
* **Success**: Full damage
* **Triumph**: Double damage and roll Major Injury

**Edge cases**
* Weapon stats are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Combat Damage**
A rifle deals **6 damage**. On a **Triumph**, it deals **12 damage** before armor.

---

### HP

**When it applies**
When tracking damage.

**How it works**
* **HP = 15 + (Vigor × 2)**.
* At **0 HP**, the colonist is **Downed** and bleeding out.

**Example: HP**
A colonist with **Vigor +1** has **17 HP**.

* **20 points = +2**
* **10 points = +1**

**Example: Quick Skill Rule**

---

## Day Loop (4 Periods)

### Periods and Actions

**When it applies**
Each in-game day.

**How it works**
* **Dawn, Midday, Dusk, Night**.
* Each colonist chooses **one major action per period**.

**Common Actions**
* Build Shelter (Construction)
* Gather Resources (Mining or Plants)
* Hunt (Shooting or Animals)
* Cook (Cooking)
* Treat Wounds (Medicine)
* Research Basics (Intellectual)
* Scout (Dexterity + Plants/Animals)
* Social Support (Social)

**Edge cases**
* Full colony actions are in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Day Loop**
At Dawn, Marla builds, Sana hunts, and Ivo treats wounds. At Night, everyone sleeps.

---

### Needs, Mood, and Stress (Light)

**When it applies**
At the end of each period.

**How it works**
* If a Need is neglected, apply **-1 Mood**.
* If **two or more** Needs are neglected, apply **+1 Stress**.

**Example: Needs and Mood**
If the group skips Food and Rest in a period, each colonist gains **-1 Mood** and **+1 Stress**.

---

### Mental Break Trigger (Quickstart)

**When it applies**
When Stress accumulates quickly.

**How it works**
Trigger a Mental Break if a colonist reaches **3 Stress** and rolls a **Complication (Story Die 10)**.

**Quick Mental Break Table (1d6)**
| d6 | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1–2** | Wander / Shut Down |
| **3–4** | Food Binge |
| **5** | Berserk |
| **6** | Sadistic / Destructive Outburst |

**Edge cases**
* Full Mental Break rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Mental Break**
Tess reaches **3 Stress** and rolls a **Story Die 10** during a fight. She rolls **1d6 = 5** and goes **Berserk**.

---

## The Crash Site

### The Map
![The Crash Site](../images/TheCrashSite.png)
A shallow valley beside **Greyhook Ridge** with a treeline to the west, a rock outcrop to the north, and a ruined shack to the east.

Purpose: Mini terrain cue for the crash site features]

---

### Starting Supplies

* 6 simple rations
* 1 bedroll per colonist
* Scrap metal (enough for 1 barricade or 1 simple room)
* 1 basic tool kit
* 1 ranged weapon total for the team plus knives

---

### The First Choice (Dawn)

**When it applies**
The first scene of the session.

**How it works**
The group chooses **Repair the Ruin** or **Build a New Lean-To** near the rocks, then makes a **group check** using **Construction** or **Survival**.

Group check (quickstart):
* Everyone rolls.
* Take the **best Tier** rolled and apply that outcome.

Outcomes:
* **Struggle**: Shelter is weak. Night defense is harder.
* **Success**: Decent shelter.
* **Triumph**: Shelter plus a basic barricade.

**Edge cases**
* If your table does not use **Survival**, substitute the most relevant skill (usually **Plants** or **Animals**).

**Example: Group Check**
Marla rolls a **Success** and Sana rolls a **Struggle**. The best Tier is **Success**, so the shelter is decent.

---

## Scripted Events (Use 2 of 3)

### Event A - The Injured Wanderer (Midday)

**When it applies**
Midday, after the first major action.

**How it works**
A bleeding survivor arrives with **medicine and a pistol**. The group must decide to help, rob, or refuse.

**Twist (Story Die 1)**: They reveal a cache location.
**Complication (Story Die 10)**: They are being tracked.

**Example: Event A**
The group helps the wanderer, gaining medicine and a future recruit lead.

---

### Event B - The Trader with Bad Timing (Dusk)

**When it applies**
Dusk, before final preparations.

**How it works**
A small caravan offers ammo, a heater, or food. Use a quick **Market Value** trade.

**Twist (Story Die 1)**: Trader offers a cheap turret blueprint.
**Complication (Story Die 10)**: Trader leads danger to the camp.

**Example: Event B**
Oren trades spare scrap for a heater and keeps the group warm at night.

---

### Event C - The Weather Knife (Any Time)

**When it applies**
Whenever you want to push tension.

**How it works**
A sudden cold snap and windstorm.
* If shelter is weak, everyone gains **+1 Stress**.
* Cooking and Rest actions are harder.
* Hypothermia risk in the night fight.

**Example: Event C**
The storm hits at Dusk. The group rushes to finish a barricade before night.

---

## The Night Threat (Finale)

### Option 1 - Manhunter Pack

**When it applies**
When you want a chaotic beast fight.

**How it works**
A pack of **6–10 maddened wolves or feral dogs** charges at night and targets the weakest colonist.

**Example: Manhunter Pack**
Sana kites the pack while Marla covers from behind the barricade.

---

### Option 2 - Desperate Raiders

**When it applies**
When you want a social standoff that turns violent.

**How it works**
**2–4 raiders** attempt intimidation, then attack if refused.

**Twist**: One raider is barely a teenager.
**Complication**: They set fire to the shelter.

**Example: Desperate Raiders**
The group refuses demands and a short Social showdown erupts into combat.

## Victory, Fallout, and Debrief

### Win Conditions

**When it applies**
At dawn after the night threat.

**How it works**
The colony wins if:
* At least **two colonists** are alive.
* The group has **shelter** and either **food** or **basic defenses**.

**Example: Win Conditions**
Two colonists survive and the shelter holds. The group wins even if supplies are low.

---

### Rewards (Light Campaign Hook)

**When it applies**
After a successful one-shot.

**How it works**
* Everyone gains **+10 Skill Points** in one used skill.
* The colony gains **1 Research Point**.
* The group chooses a Storyteller mode for the next session.

**Edge cases**
* Full advancement rules are in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**Example: Rewards**
Sana adds **+10 Skill Points** to Shooting, and the group chooses **Cassandra Classic** for Session 2.
