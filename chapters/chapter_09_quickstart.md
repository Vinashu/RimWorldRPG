## Page 1 — What You Need to Play

### The Premise

Your shuttle breaks apart over a frozen-forest Rimworld. You crash near **Greyhook Ridge** with almost nothing. The first day decides everything: **get shelter, food, and a basic defense before nightfall**.

You are not heroes.
You are colonists.

### The One-Sentence Goal

**Survive the first night and secure a defensible foothold** — or at least ensure someone is alive to bury the bodies.

### The Table Setup

* Each player takes a pregen colonist (below).
* The Storyteller runs the day loop and interrupts it with events.
* Keep scenes short and cinematic.

### Dice & Resolution

Players always roll **2d10** (one Base + one **red Story Die**) + Attribute + Skill.

**Tiers (default):**

* **11-** Struggle
* **12–16** Success
* **17+** Triumph

**Edge/Bane:**

* **Edge:** reroll either die once
* **Bane:** Storyteller rerolls one die that looks too good

**Story Die triggers:**

* **1 = Twist of Fate** (Inspiration/Edge/boon)
* **10 = Complication** (Bane/Stress/Mood hit/new danger)

> *Use this quickstart as the “tiers-first” version (no DC needed tonight).*

## Page 2 — The Day Loop (4 Periods)

**Each day has 4 periods:** Dawn, Midday, Dusk, Night.
Each colonist chooses **one major action per period**.
The Storyteller frames short scenes and advances needs/mood.

### Period Actions (use 1–2 rolls each)

* **Build Shelter** (Construction)
* **Gather Resources** (Mining/Plants)
* **Hunt** (Shooting/Animals)
* **Cook** (Cooking)
* **Treat Wounds** (Medicine)
* **Research Basics** (Intellectual)
* **Scout** (Reflex/Survival)
* **Social Support** (Social) — reduce Stress or restore Mood

### Needs & Mood (light version for quickstart)

At the end of each period, apply:

* If a Need is neglected, mark **-1 Mood**.
* If two or more Needs are neglected, mark **+1 Stress**.

**Trigger a Mental Break** if a colonist reaches **3 Stress** and rolls a **Complication (Story Die 10)**.

**Quick Mental Break table (d6):**
1–2 **Wander / Shut Down**
3–4 **Food Binge**
5 **Berserk**
6 **Sadistic / Destructive Outburst**

## Page 2 — The Crash Site

### The Map
![The Crash Site](../images/TheCrashSite.png)
A shallow valley beside **Greyhook Ridge**:

* **Treeline** to the west (cover + hunt)
* **Rock outcrop** to the north (good for a barricade)
* **Ruined shack** to the east (half-collapsed)
* **Stream** south (clean water if boiled)

### Starting Supplies

* 6 simple rations
* 1 bedroll per colonist
* Scrap metal (enough for 1 barricade or 1 simple room)
* 1 basic tool kit
* 1 ranged weapon total for the team + knives
  *(Let Sana start with the rifle if she’s in play.)*

### The First Choice (Dawn)

The group must decide:
**Repair the ruin** or **build a new lean-to** near the rocks.

Use a **group check** (Construction or Survival).

* **Struggle:** shelter is weak → **night defense is harder**
* **Success:** decent shelter
* **Triumph:** shelter + basic barricade

## Page 3 — Scripted Events (use 2 of 3)

You only need two major events to hit all systems.

### Event A — The Injured Wanderer (Midday)

A lone survivor stumbles in, bleeding and delirious.
They have a **pack of medicine + a pistol**.

**Choices:**

* Help them (Medicine + Social)
* Rob them (Melee/Social)
* Turn them away (Mood impact)

**Twist (Story Die 1):**
They reveal a **cache location** nearby.
**Complication (Story Die 10):**
They’re being tracked.

This scene comes with an easy opportunity to introduce **Social Support**, **Mood**, and **Ethics under pressure**.

---

### Event B — The Trader with Bad Timing (Dusk)

A small caravan arrives.
They’ll trade **ammo, a heater, or food**.

Run a quick **Market Value** moment:

* Social skill can improve deals.
* Players can trade scrap, rations, or favors.

**Twist:**
Trader offers a cheap turret blueprint.
**Complication:**
Trader accidentally leads danger to your camp.

This is your light introduction to **economy** and **colony tech stakes**.

---

### Event C — The Weather Knife (Any time)

A sudden cold snap and windstorm.

Mechanically:

* If shelter is weak → everyone gains **+1 Stress**
* Cooking / Rest actions are harder
* Hypothermia risk in the night fight

This supports **Needs/Mood/Stress** pressure.

---

## Page 3 — The Night Threat (Finale)

Pick one based on your table’s vibe:

### Option 1 — **Manhunter Pack**

A pack of 6–10 maddened wolves or feral dogs charges at night.
They target **the noisiest or weakest** colonist first.

**Play tips:**

* Emphasize **cover**, **kiting**, and **triage**
* Let a **Triumph** enable clever tactics (trap use, collapsing ruin, etc.)

### Option 2 — **Desperate Raiders**

2–4 poorly equipped raiders attack looking for supplies.
They attempt intimidation first.

Use:

* A short **Social showdown** before bullets
* Then **combat**

**Twist:**
One raider is barely a teenager.
**Complication:**
They set fire to your only shelter.

## Page 4 — Victory, Fallout, and Fast Debrief

### Win Conditions

The colony “wins” if, by morning:

* At least **two colonists alive**, and
* The group has **shelter + either food or basic defenses**.

### If They Barely Survive

That is the *correct* RimWorld vibe.
End with:

* A quiet sunrise
* A body being buried
* A promise of the next season

### Rewards (light campaign hook)

* Everyone gains **+10 Skill Points** in one used skill
* The colony gains **1 Research Point**
* The group chooses a **Storyteller mode** for next session
  (Cassandra / Phoebe / Randy)
