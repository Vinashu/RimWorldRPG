# Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy

Survival on the Rim requires the right tools. A sharp knife, a warm parka, and a pocket full of silver can make the difference between life and death.

---

## Economy

### Currency and Starting Wealth

**When it applies**
When the campaign begins or when trading.

**How it works**
* The universal currency of the Rim is **Silver**.
* Starting wealth and gear are determined by your Arrival Scenario in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**Edge cases**
* Some scenarios start with gear instead of Silver.

**Example: Starting Wealth**
A Crashlanded group starts with listed gear instead of a pile of Silver, then begins trading as soon as a caravan arrives.

---

### Market Value

**When it applies**
When determining the base value of an item.

**How it works**
Use the formula below.

**Market Value = Material Cost + (Crafting Points × 0.5)**

**Edge cases**
* If an item has no material cost, treat it as **0**.
* Crafting Points (CP) are generated in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Market Value**
A weapon costs **60 Steel** and **100 CP**. Market Value = 60 + (100 × 0.5) = **110 Silver**.

---

### Trading Prices

**When it applies**
When buying or selling items with a trader.

**How it works**
1. Start with Market Value.
2. Apply base prices.
3. Apply the Social Bonus.

| Price Type | Base Rate |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Buy** | 140% of Market Value |
| **Sell** | 60% of Market Value |

**Social Bonus**
* Improve prices by **2% per Social Skill Point**, up to **±40%**.

**Edge cases**
* Use the Social skill rules in [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).
* The maximum bonus is reached at **Social 20**.

**Example: Trading**
Viper sells a sculpture with **Market Value 500**. Base sell price is **60% = 300 Silver**. She has **Social 10**, improving prices by **20%**, so she sells at **80% = 400 Silver**.

---

### Common Item Values

| Item | Market Value | Materials | Crafting Points (CP) | Tech |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Meal (Simple)** | 15 | 10 Food | 10 | Neolithic 1 |
| **Meal (Fine)** | 25 | 20 Food | 20 | Medieval 2 |
| **Medicine (Herbal)** | 10 | - | - | Neolithic 2 |
| **Medicine (Industrial)** | 50 | 3 Cloth, 1 Neutroamine | 40 | Industrial 2 |
| **Component** | 30 | 12 Steel | 60 | Industrial 1 |
| **Advanced Component** | 200 | 1 Component, 20 Steel, 10 Plasteel, 3 Gold | 200 | Spacer 1 |

## Item Quality

### Crafting Quality Roll

**When it applies**
When an item’s Crafting Points requirement is completed.

**How it works**
1. Roll **Dexterity + Crafting**.
2. Apply the Tier result below.

| Tier | Quality | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 (11-)** | **Normal** | Standard stats. |
| **Tier 2 (12–16)** | **Good** | **+1 Accuracy/Damage** (Weapons) or **+1 Armor** (Apparel). |
| **Tier 3 (17+)** | **Masterwork** | **+2 Stats**. Value ×1.5. |
| **Critical (Natural 10)** | **Legendary** | **+3 Stats**. Value ×2. Gain Art/Name. |

**Edge cases**
* The Crafting check uses the Skill rules in [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md).
* **Natural 10** refers to the **Story Die** result.

**Example: Item Quality**
Oren finishes a flak vest and rolls **2d10 + Dexterity + Crafting**. He totals **18** (Tier 3), so the vest is **Masterwork** and gains **+2 Armor**.

## Weapons

### Weapon Stats

**When it applies**
Whenever you use a weapon in combat.

**How it works**
* **Damage**: Base damage on a **Tier 2** hit.
* **Band**: Optimal **Range Band** (see [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md)).
* **AP**: Action Point cost to attack (see [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md)).

**Edge cases**
* Range penalties apply outside a weapon’s optimal band (Chapter 1).
* Attack resolution is in Chapter 4.

**Example: Weapon Line**
A **Revolver** has **Damage 4**, **Band Close**, and **AP 2**. On a Tier 2 hit it deals **4 damage**, and it costs **2 AP** to fire.
