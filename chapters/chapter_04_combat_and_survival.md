Purpose: Chapter opener establishing survival + combat tone and stakes]

Life on the Rim is a constant struggle against hunger, madness, and violent death. This chapter covers the rules for keeping your colonists alive—both physically and mentally.

---

## Part 1: Survival & Needs

### Core Needs

**When it applies**
All day, every day.

**How it works**
Use the requirements below. If a requirement is not met, apply the listed penalty.

| Need | Requirement | Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Food** | 2 Meals per day | **+1 Stress** per missed meal. After 3 days, take **1d10 Damage** per day (Starvation). |
| **Rest** | 8 hours of sleep | **+1 Stress** per night of poor/missed sleep. Become **Fatigued (-2 to all rolls)**. |
| **Recreation** | 4 hours of leisure time | **+1 Stress** if ignored for 2+ days. |
| **Beauty** | Clean rooms, art, paved floors | **+1 Stress** if spending 4+ hours in an "Ugly" space. |
| **Comfort** | Chairs, beds, temperature control | **+1 Stress** after sleeping on the ground or in extreme heat/cold. |

[Art: spot/ch04_core_needs_01.png
Purpose: Visual anchor for daily survival needs]

**Edge cases**
* Two or more Colonists working on the same activity in the same period count as **Socializing** for Recreation.
* Traits can modify Rest or Comfort (see [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)).
* Colony schedules and periods are defined in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Core Needs**
Viper misses **one meal** (+1 Stress) and sleeps in the cold (+1 Stress). She gains **2 Stress** by morning.

---

### Gaining Stress

**When it applies**
Whenever a Colonist experiences strain, danger, or deprivation.

**How it works**
Gain Stress from the triggers below.

| Trigger | Stress |
| :--- | ---: |
| Unmet Need | See Core Needs table |
| Pushing a Roll | +1 Stress |
| Witnessing Death (Stranger/Enemy) | +1 Stress |
| Witnessing Death (Colonist/Bonded Animal) | +3 Stress |
| Untended Wounds or Painful Scars (per day) | +1 Stress |

**Edge cases**
* "Bonded" is a Storyteller-assigned relationship tag (see [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)).

**Example: Gaining Stress**
Marla pushes a roll (+1 Stress) and then watches a bonded muffalo die (+3 Stress). She gains **4 Stress** in that scene.

---

### Stress Die

**When it applies**
When a rule tells you to roll a **Stress Die**.

**How it works**
* Roll **1d6** and add it to your total.
* If **any Stress Die** shows **1**, trigger a **Panic Check**.

**Edge cases**
* The **Push** adds a Stress Die (see [Chapter 3: Skills & Checks](chapter_03_skills_and_checks.md)).

**Example: Stress Die**
Oren rolls a Stress Die and gets a **1**. He adds the **1** to his total, then immediately makes a **Panic Check** after the action.

Purpose: Show the Stress Die triggering a Panic Check]

---

### Panic Check (Mental Break)

**When it applies**
When a rule triggers a Panic Check (Stress Die result of 1, a Push, certain traits, or a Mental Break Threshold trigger).

**How it works**
1. Roll **1d6 + Current Stress**.
2. Apply the result from the table below.

| Result | Break Type | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1–6** | **Anxious** | **Trembling**: -2 to all Dexterity/Shooting rolls for 1 hour. |
| **7–9** | **Minor Break** | **Binge**: Consume 3x Meals or Drugs immediately. |
| **10–12** | **Major Break** | **Tantrum**: Attack a random colony structure/item (it loses 10 CP). |
| **13+** | **Extreme Break** | **Insulting Spree**: Verbally abuse allies. Each ally gains **+1 Stress**. |

[Art: diagrams/ch04_panic_check_flow_01.png
Purpose: Flowchart of Panic Check triggers and result bands]

**Edge cases**
* Mental Break Threshold rules are in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md).

**Example: Panic Check**
Tess has **5 Stress** and rolls a **4** on the d6. Total = **9**, so she suffers a **Minor Break** and goes on a Binge.

---

### Relieving Stress

**When it applies**
After crises, during downtime, or through special actions.

**How it works**
Reduce Stress using the options below.

| Method | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Luxury Meal** | Remove **2 Stress**. |
| **Relaxing Socially** | On a **Tier 2** Social check, remove **1 Stress**. |
| **Catharsis** | Completing a Mental Break resets Stress to **0**. |
| **Sleep (Excellent+ Bed)** | A full night’s sleep removes **all Stress**. |

**Edge cases**
* Meal types and bed quality are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md) and [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Relieving Stress**
Viper has **5 Stress**. She eats a **Luxury Meal** (down to **3**), then sleeps in an **Excellent** bed and returns to **0**.

---

## Part 2: Combat

### Initiative

**When it applies**
At the start of combat.

**How it works**
1. The players make a **group roll** of **1d10**.
2. On **6–10**, players act first.
3. On **1–5**, enemies act first.

**Example: Initiative**
The group rolls a **7** on the Initiative check. Players act first.

---

### Turns and Rounds

**When it applies**
After Initiative.

**How it works**
1. The two sides alternate turns (Players → Enemies → Players).
2. A **Round** ends when all combatants have acted once.

**Edge cases**
* If one side has no combatants left, the encounter ends.

**Example: Turns and Rounds**
Players act, then enemies act. When both sides have taken a turn, the round ends and a new round begins.

---

### Action Points (AP)

**When it applies**
On a Colonist’s turn.

**How it works**
Each Colonist has **4 AP** per turn to spend on actions.

| Action | AP | Effect |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Move** | 1 | Shift **one Range Band** closer or farther. |
| **Rush** | 2 | Shift **two Range Bands**. |
| **Attack** | 2 | Make a Shooting or Melee attack. |
| **Aim** | 1 | Gain **Augmented** on your next attack. |
| **Take Cover** | 1 | Attacks against you take **Bane**. |
| **Aid** | 1 | Grant **Edge** to an ally’s next roll. |
| **Use Item** | 1 | Reload, switch weapon, or use a consumable. |

[Art: diagrams/ch04_combat_loop_ap_01.png
Purpose: Combat loop with AP inset]

**Edge cases**
* Range Bands are defined in [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md).

**Example: Spending AP**
Marla spends **1 AP** to Move to Close range, **1 AP** to Take Cover, and **2 AP** to Attack.

[Art: spot/ch04_spending_ap_01.png
Purpose: Visualize Move + Take Cover + Attack in one turn]

---

### Attack Resolution

**When it applies**
When you take the Attack action.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**.
2. Attacks always hit; the Tier determines damage.

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1: Weak Hit** | Deal **Half Damage**. |
| **12–16** | **Tier 2: Solid Hit** | Deal **Full Damage**. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3: Critical Hit** | Deal **Double Damage** and roll **Major Injury**. |

**Edge cases**
* Weapon stats are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Attack Roll**
Viper shoots with **Dexterity +1** and **Shooting 20 (+2)**. She rolls **Base Die 8** and **Story Die 6**. Total = 8 + 6 + 1 + 2 = **17**, a **Tier 3 Critical Hit**.

---

### Damage and Armor

**When it applies**
After an attack hit is resolved.

**How it works**
1. Calculate **Damage = (Weapon Damage × Tier Multiplier) - Armor Rating**.
2. Apply the remaining damage to HP.
3. **HP** = `15 + (Vigor × 2)`.
4. At **0 HP**, a character is **Downed** and begins bleeding out for **Vigor hours (minimum 1 hour)** unless tended.

**Edge cases**
* Armor values are listed in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Damage and Armor**
A rifle does **6 Damage**. Viper hits at **Tier 3**, so damage is **12**. The raider has **Armor 3**, so final damage is **9**.

---

### Critical Effects and Conditions

**When it applies**
When an attack results in a **Tier 3 Critical Hit**.

**How it works**
1. If the target has Cover, reduce it one step (**Heavy → Light → None**).
2. Apply any weapon or effect conditions.

| Condition | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stunned** | Lose your next Action Turn (0 AP). |
| **Slowed** | Movement costs **+1 AP**. |
| **Paralyzed** | Cannot Move or Act. Defense is 0 (Auto-Crit). |

[Art: diagrams/ch04_critical_effects_01.png
Purpose: Show cover reduction and condition outcomes on a critical hit]

**Edge cases**
* Some weapons apply additional conditions (see Chapter 5).

**Example: Critical Condition**
Sana lands a **Tier 3** hit on a raider behind **Heavy Cover**. The cover drops to **Light Cover**, and the raider is **Stunned**.

---

### Major Injuries

**When it applies**
After a **Tier 3 Critical Hit** or specific traps and events.

**How it works**
Roll **1d10** and apply the result.

| d10 | Injury | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1–3** | **Bleeding** | Take **1 Damage/turn** until tended. |
| **4** | **Stunned** | Lose your next Action Turn (0 AP). |
| **5** | **Slowed** | Movement costs **+1 AP** for 1 hour. |
| **6** | **Concussion** | **Impaired** on mental actions. Skills disabled. |
| **7** | **Organ Damage (Lung)** | **-2 Bane** on Movement/Vigor checks (Breathing). |
| **8** | **Organ Damage (Heart)** | Bleed-out time reduced by half. |
| **9** | **Eye/Ear Loss** | Permanent **-2 Bane** on Perception/Shooting. |
| **10** | **Severed Part** | Lose a limb. Roll **1d4**: (1) Hand, (2) Arm, (3) Leg, (4) Head (Instant death). |

**Edge cases**
* Prosthetics and bionics are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Major Injury**
Marla rolls a **7** on the Major Injury table. She suffers **Organ Damage (Lung)** and takes **-2 Bane** on Movement/Vigor checks.

---

### Body Part Banes (Permanent)

**When it applies**
When a character loses a body part.

**How it works**
Apply the relevant penalty until replaced.

| Lost Part | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Hand** | **+1 Bane** to fine motor skills (Shooting, Crafting, Medical). Cannot dual-wield. |
| **Missing Arm** | **+2 Bane** to fine motor skills. Cannot use two-handed items. |
| **Missing Foot** | Movement actions cost **+1 AP**. |
| **Missing Leg** | Cannot take Movement actions (must crawl or be carried). |
| **Missing Eye** | **+1 Bane** to Shooting and Perception. |
| **Missing Ear** | **+1 Bane** to Social and Awareness. |
| **Organ Damage** | See Major Injury table. |

**Edge cases**
* Replacement limbs cancel penalties as described in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Body Part Banes**
After losing her left arm, Viper suffers **+2 Bane** on Medical checks and cannot use her two-handed rifle.

---

### Death and Downed

**When it applies**
When a character reaches **0 HP**.

**How it works**
* At **0 HP**, the character is **Downed** and unconscious.
* If they take damage while Downed, they **die**.
* If they are not tended before their bleed-out time expires, they **die**.

**Edge cases**
* Tending rules are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md) and [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Death and Downed**
A colonist drops to **0 HP** and is Downed. A raider attacks them again, dealing damage. The colonist **dies** immediately.

---

## Part 3: Expeditions (Caravans)

### Travel Speed

**When it applies**
When traveling across the world map.

**How it works**
* **Base Speed**: 1 Hex per day.
* **Modifiers**: +1 for mounts, +1 on roads, -1 in difficult terrain or winter.

**Edge cases**
* Hex scale is defined in [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md).

**Example: Travel Speed**
A caravan with mounts on roads moves **3 Hexes** in **1 day** (base 1 + mounts 1 + roads 1).

---

### Foraging and Rations

**When it applies**
Each day of travel.

**How it works**
1. Each colonist consumes **2 Meals**.
2. If you have no rations, make a **Plants** check vs **DC 12**.
3. On Success, find enough wild food.
4. On **Tier 1 (Struggle)**, everyone gains **+1 Stress** and **Starvation** begins.

**Edge cases**
* This subsystem uses a DC as written, even though most checks use Tiers.

**Example: Foraging**
The caravan is out of rations. Tess rolls **2d10 + Mind + Plants** and totals **10** (Tier 1). Everyone gains **+1 Stress** and Starvation starts.

---

### Ambushes

**When it applies**
For every **3 Hexes** traveled.

**How it works**
1. The Storyteller rolls for an event.
2. Players may roll **Intellectual** (Scanning) or **Animals** (Scouting).
3. On Success, they spot the ambush and choose distance or evade.
4. On **Tier 1 (Struggle)**, they are ambushed. Enemies start with Initiative and Cover.

**Edge cases**
* Enemy stats are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Ambush**
After 3 Hexes, Sana rolls **Animals** and totals **13** (Tier 2). The group spots raiders early and chooses **Medium** range.

[Art: spot/ch04_ambushes_01.png
Purpose: Illustrate scouting/ambush risk during caravan travel]

---

### Carrying Capacity

**When it applies**
When transporting heavy goods.

**How it works**
* Colonists can carry personal gear.
* **Pack Animals** (Muffalo, Alpaca) are required for heavy trade goods.
* **Overburdened** caravans move at **0.5 Hexes/day**.

**Edge cases**
* Pack animal stats are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Carrying Capacity**
The caravan loads too much steel and becomes **Overburdened**. Their speed drops to **0.5 Hexes/day**.
