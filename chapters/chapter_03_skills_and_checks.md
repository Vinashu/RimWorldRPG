# Chapter 3: Skills & Checks

[Art: chapter_art/ch03_skills_checks_01.png
Purpose: Chapter opener establishing skills-and-checks training tone]

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, you make a **Skill Check** (also called a **Colonist Roll** in Chapter 1). This chapter explains how checks work and what each skill covers.

## Skill Check

**When it applies**
When a Colonist attempts an action with uncertain results and a skill is relevant.

**How it works**
1. Roll **2d10** (one **Base Die** and one **Story Die**).
2. Add the relevant **Attribute**.
3. Add your **Skill Modifier**.
4. Compare the total to the **Tier of Success** table.
5. Apply any Story Die effects (see [Chapter 1: Core Mechanics](chapter_01_core.md)).

[Art: diagrams/ch03_skill_check_flow_01.png
Purpose: Flowchart of the Skill Check sequence and Story Die callouts]

**Edge cases**
* The Story Die can trigger a **Twist of Fate** or **Complication** even if its value is discarded by **Augmented** or **Impaired** rolls.
* Skill Modifiers are based on Skill Points (see below).

**Example: Skill Check**
Viper attempts a Social check with **Spirit +1** and **Social 25 (+2)**. She rolls **Base Die 6** and **Story Die 7**. Total = 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 = **16**, a **Tier 2 (Success)**.

---

## Tiers of Success

**When it applies**
After any Skill Check.

**How it works**
| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You achieve the goal, but it costs time, resources, or safety. |
| **12-16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve the goal cleanly. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You achieve the goal with extra benefits. |

**Edge cases**
* Combat outcomes use the combat rules in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).
* Colony task outputs (Food, CP, RP) are listed in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Tier Result**
Marla rolls a total of **10** on a Construction check. She succeeds with a **Tier 1 (Struggle)** result and finishes the job, but uses extra materials.

---

## Difficulty Without DCs

**When it applies**
When the Storyteller needs to adjust how hard a check is.

**How it works**
1. For easy tasks, grant **Edge (+2)** or allow automatic success.
2. For hard tasks, apply **Bane (-2)** or make the cost of **Tier 1** severe.
3. For extreme tasks, use **Double Edge** or **Double Bane** shifts.

**Edge cases**
* Some subsystems list specific DCs (for example, Term Survival in [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)). Use those rules as written.

**Example: Difficulty Without DCs**
A simple lock is old and rusted. The Storyteller rules it opens automatically without a roll. A high-tech vault in combat gets **Bane** and a harsh Tier 1 cost.

---

## Skill Modifiers

**When it applies**
Whenever you add a skill to a check.

**How it works**
Your **Skill Points** (0–30) determine your **Skill Modifier**.

| Skill Points | Modifier |
| :--- | ---: |
| 0–9 | +0 |
| 10–19 | +1 |
| 20–29 | +2 |
| 30 | +3 |

[Art: diagrams/ch03_skill_modifiers_01.png
Purpose: Quick visual mapping of Skill Points to Modifiers]

**Edge cases**
* The starting **Skill Cap** is **30** (see [Chapter 2: Character Creation](chapter_02_character_creation.md)).

**Example: Skill Modifier**
Sana has **Animals 22**. Her Skill Modifier is **+2**.

---

## Modifiers

### Edge and Bane

**When it applies**
When a circumstance gives a minor advantage or disadvantage.

**How it works**
* **Edge** adds **+2** to the roll.
* **Bane** subtracts **-2** from the roll.

**Edge cases**
* Cover, lighting, and positioning are common sources (see [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md)).

**Example: Edge and Bane**
Viper shoots in darkness (**Bane**) but has a laser sight (**Edge**). The modifiers cancel, so she rolls normally.

Purpose: Visualize Edge and Bane canceling out]

### Double Edge and Double Bane

**When it applies**
When you have at least two sources of Edge or Bane.

**How it works**
* **Double Edge**: Shift your result **up one Tier**.
* **Double Bane**: Shift your result **down one Tier**.

**Edge cases**
* The shift happens after you total the roll.

**Example: Double Edge**
Marla rolls **14** on a Shooting check (Tier 2). She has **two** Edges (high ground and target in the open), so the result shifts to **Tier 3**.

### Cancel

**When it applies**
When you have both Edge and Bane.

**How it works**
* Cancel one Edge against one Bane.
* If one side remains, apply **one** Edge or **one** Bane.

**Edge cases**
* You never apply more than one remaining Edge or Bane after cancellation.

**Example: Cancel**
Oren has **two** Banes (rain and smoke) and **one** Edge (stabilized rifle). One Bane cancels the Edge, leaving **one Bane** applied to the roll.

### Augmented and Impaired

**When it applies**
When a circumstance grants a major advantage or disadvantage.

**How it works**
* **Augmented**: Roll **3d10 (keep highest 2)**.
* **Impaired**: Roll **3d10 (keep lowest 2)**.

**Edge cases**
* Augmented/Impaired replace Edge and Bane.
* The Story Die effect still applies even if its value is discarded.

**Example: Augmented**
Ivo performs surgery with a glitterworld kit. He rolls **3d10**: **Story Die 1**, **Base Die 8**, extra die **9**. He keeps **9 + 8 = 17**, then adds **Mind +2** and **Medical 30 (+3)** for a total of **22** (Tier 3). The **Story Die 1** triggers a Twist of Fate.

**Example: Impaired**
Sana fires while suppressed (**Impaired**). She rolls **3d10**: **Story Die 10**, **Base Die 4**, extra die **7**. She keeps **4 + 7 = 11**, then adds **Dexterity +2** and **Shooting 20 (+2)** for a total of **15** (Tier 2). The **Story Die 10** triggers a Complication.

## Pushing Your Luck

**When it applies**
When you voluntarily risk Stress to improve a roll.

**How it works**
1. Declare a **Push**.
2. Add **+1 Stress**.
3. Roll **1d6** and add it to your total.
4. If the **d6** shows **1**, trigger a **Panic Check** (see [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md)).

**Edge cases**
* The Push happens after the initial roll but before Tiers are applied.

**Example: Push**
Tess rolls **9** on an Intellectual check with **Mind +2** and **Intellectual 10 (+1)** for a total of **12** (Tier 2). She Pushes, gains **+1 Stress**, rolls **1d6 = 3**, and the total becomes **15** (still Tier 2). If the d6 had been a **1**, she would immediately make a Panic Check after the action.

## Skill List

### Shooting (Dexterity)

**When it applies**
Ranged attacks, turrets, and mortars.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Dexterity + Shooting**. Tier results determine hit quality and damage in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Edge cases**
* Cover and range bands apply (Chapter 4).

**Example: Shooting**
Viper rolls **Base Die 7** and **Story Die 4** with **Dexterity +1** and **Shooting 20 (+2)**. Total = 7 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **14** (Tier 2). She deals standard weapon damage.

### Melee (Vigor)

**When it applies**
Hand-to-hand combat with blades or blunt weapons.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Vigor + Melee**. Tier results determine hit quality and damage in Chapter 4.

**Edge cases**
* Entering Melee range is defined in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Melee**
Marla rolls **Base Die 5** and **Story Die 6** with **Vigor +2** and **Melee 10 (+1)**. Total = 5 + 6 + 2 + 1 = **14** (Tier 2).

### Construction (Vigor)

**When it applies**
Building, repairing, or dismantling structures.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Vigor + Construction**. Convert the Tier to **Construction Points (CP)** in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Edge cases**
* Some Facilities require specific Tech Levels (Chapter 6).

**Example: Construction**
Marla rolls **Base Die 8** and **Story Die 3** with **Vigor +2** and **Construction 20 (+2)**. Total = 8 + 3 + 2 + 2 = **15** (Tier 2), yielding **5 CP**.

### Mining (Vigor)

**When it applies**
Digging, extracting ore, and smoothing stone.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Vigor + Mining**. Convert the Tier to resource yields in Chapter 6.

**Edge cases**
* Certain biomes grant Mining modifiers (see [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md)).

**Example: Mining**
Oren rolls **Base Die 6** and **Story Die 2** with **Vigor +1** and **Mining 10 (+1)**. Total = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **10** (Tier 1), yielding **1 Ore**.

### Cooking (Dexterity)

**When it applies**
Preparing meals, butchering, and processing food.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Dexterity + Cooking**. Use the Cooking conversion outputs in Chapter 6.

**Edge cases**
* Food poisoning risks are handled in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Cooking**
Ivo rolls **Base Die 7** and **Story Die 5** with **Dexterity -1** and **Cooking 20 (+2)**. Total = 7 + 5 - 1 + 2 = **13** (Tier 2), converting **2 Food** into **3 Meals**.

### Plants (Mind)

**When it applies**
Sowing, harvesting, foraging, and cutting trees.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Mind + Plants**. Use the yield table in Chapter 6.

**Edge cases**
* Biome modifiers can apply (Chapter 7).

**Example: Plants**
Sana rolls **Base Die 9** and **Story Die 4** with **Mind +0** and **Plants 20 (+2)**. Total = 9 + 4 + 0 + 2 = **15** (Tier 2).

### Animals (Spirit)

**When it applies**
Taming, training, and handling animals.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Spirit + Animals**. The Storyteller applies the Tier to the animal’s response.

**Edge cases**
* Failed checks against predators can trigger a Manhunter reaction (Chapter 4).

**Example: Animals**
Tess rolls **Base Die 5** and **Story Die 2** with **Spirit +0** and **Animals 10 (+1)**. Total = 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 = **8** (Tier 1). The muffalo resists and wanders off.

### Crafting (Dexterity)

**When it applies**
Smithing, tailoring, machining, and assembly work.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Dexterity + Crafting**. The result determines **Item Quality** in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Edge cases**
* Crafting Points (CP) are earned through colony work in Chapter 6.

**Example: Crafting**
Oren rolls **Base Die 8** and **Story Die 8** with **Dexterity +1** and **Crafting 30 (+3)**. Total = 8 + 8 + 1 + 3 = **20** (Tier 3), producing **Masterwork** quality.

### Artistic (Spirit)

**When it applies**
Creating sculptures, music, or morale-boosting art.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Spirit + Artistic**. The Tier sets the art’s quality and Mood impact.

**Edge cases**
* Mood effects are handled in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Artistic**
Marla rolls **Base Die 6** and **Story Die 6** with **Spirit -1** and **Artistic 20 (+2)**. Total = 6 + 6 - 1 + 2 = **13** (Tier 2). The art grants a modest Mood bonus.

### Medical (Mind)

**When it applies**
Tending wounds, surgery, and disease treatment.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Mind + Medical**. Apply healing effects and risks per Chapter 4.

**Edge cases**
* Medicine items are in [Chapter 5: Equipment & Economy](chapter_05_equipment.md).

**Example: Medical**
Ivo rolls **Base Die 6** and **Story Die 6** with **Mind +2** and **Medical 30 (+3)**. Total = 6 + 6 + 2 + 3 = **17** (Tier 3). The patient stabilizes quickly.

### Social (Spirit)

**When it applies**
Trading, recruiting, peace talks, and calming others.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Spirit + Social**. Apply effects using the relevant subsystem (trade in Chapter 5, recruitment in Chapter 6, factions in Chapter 7).

**Edge cases**
* Some Social outcomes depend on Goodwill (Chapter 7).

**Example: Social**
Viper rolls **Base Die 7** and **Story Die 5** with **Spirit +1** and **Social 20 (+2)**. Total = 7 + 5 + 1 + 2 = **15** (Tier 2). The trader agrees to a fair price.

### Intellectual (Mind)

**When it applies**
Research, scanning, and solving technical problems.

**How it works**
Make a Skill Check using **Mind + Intellectual**. Apply research progress in Chapter 6.

**Edge cases**
* Long tasks like Research require cumulative progress (Chapter 6).

**Example: Intellectual**
Tess rolls **Base Die 9** and **Story Die 3** with **Mind +2** and **Intellectual 20 (+2)**. Total = 9 + 3 + 2 + 2 = **16** (Tier 2), granting **50 RP**.
