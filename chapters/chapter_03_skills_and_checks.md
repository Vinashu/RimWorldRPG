# Chapter 3: Skills & Checks

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, you roll the dice.

---

## The Core Mechanic
To resolve any challenge, roll **2d10** and add your relevant **Attribute** and **Skill Modifier**.

> **Result = 2d10 + Attribute + Skill Modifier**

We do not use a "Pass/Fail" Difficulty Class. Instead, your Result determines the **Tier of Success**:

| Result | Tier | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11 or lower** | **Tier 1 (Struggle)** | **Success with a Major Cost**. You achieve your goal, but things get messy. You are spotted, you take damage, or it costs extra resources. |
| **12 - 16** | **Tier 2 (Success)** | **Standard Success**. You achieve your goal cleanly and effectively. |
| **17 or higher** | **Tier 3 (Triumph)** | **Critical Success**. You win. Double damage, half time, or extra benefits. |

> **Example: Negotiating**
> **John**: "Viper is trying to negotiate a lower price for the medicine."
> **Mary**: "Okay, Viper has **Spirit +1** and **Social 25 (+2)**. So I add +3 to my roll."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 2d10)* "I got a 6 and a 7. Total is 13 + 3 = 16."
> **John**: "That's a **Tier 2 Success**. The trader agrees to your price without complaint."

### Where is the Difficulty?
There are no "DCs" to beat. Difficulty is handled through **Modifiers** and **Narrative Consequences**.
*   **Easy Task**: The Storyteller might rule it succeeds automatically, or grant an **Edge (+2)**.
*   **Hard Task**: The Storyteller will apply a **Bane (-2)**, or warn that a Tier 1 result will have severe consequences.

### Skill Modifiers
Your **Skill Points** (0-30) determine your modifier for the roll.
*   **0-9 Points**: +0
*   **10-19 Points**: +1
*   **20-29 Points**: +2
*   **30 Points**: +3 (Master)

## Modifiers
Circumstances can help or hinder you.

### Minor Modifiers (+2 / -2)
*   **Edge (+2)**: Minor advantage (High ground, good tools).
*   **Bane (-2)**: Minor disadvantage (Darkness, poor tools).

> **Example: Edge & Bane**
> **John**: "You're shooting at the raider, but it's dark (**Bane**). However, you have a high-quality scope (**Edge**)."
> **Mary**: "So the Edge and Bane cancel out?"
> **John**: "Exactly. Just roll straight. 2d10 + Dexterity + Shooting."

### Double Modifiers
*   **Double Edge**: If you have 2+ sources of Edge, shift your Result **UP one Tier** (e.g., Tier 2 becomes Tier 3).
*   **Double Bane**: If you have 2+ sources of Bane, shift your Result **DOWN one Tier**.

> **Example: Double Edge**
> **John**: "You have the high ground (**Edge**) AND the raider is out in the open (**Edge**). That's **Double Edge**."
> **Mary**: "So if I succeed, the result is upgraded?"
> **John**: "Yes. A **Tier 2 (Success)** becomes a **Tier 3 (Triumph)**. A **Tier 1 (Struggle)** becomes a **Tier 2 (Success)**."

### Cancel Modifiers
*   **Cancel**: If a Player has one **Edge** and one **Bane**, they will cancel each other out. If you have more sources of Edge than Bane, you can cancel all sources of Bane and keep with one source of Edge. The same in the other way around.

### Major Modifiers (3d10)
*   **Augmented**: Major advantage (Bionics, drugs, perfect position). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Highest**.
*   **Impaired**: Major disadvantage (Blindness, toxicity, suppression). Roll **3d10** and keep the **2 Lowest**.

> **Example: Augmented**
> **John**: "Viper has a bionic eye targeting system. That counts as **Augmented** for this shot."
> **Mary**: "Okay, I roll **3d10** and keep the highest two."
> **Mary**: *(Rolls 3, 8, 9)* "I keep the 8 and 9. Total 17 + Modifiers."

*Note: You can not have both Edge and Augmented on the same roll.*

*Note: The result of the Story Die is **always** applied, even its value is discarded in an Augmented or Impaired roll.*

## Pushing Your Luck
Life on the Rim is desperate. You can push yourself beyond your limits.
*   **The Push**: You can voluntarily add **+1d6** to your roll.
*   **The Risk**: If the **d6** rolls a **1**, you trigger a **Panic Check** immediately after the action (regardless of success or failure).

> **Example: The Push**
> **Mary**: "I rolled an 11 (Tier 1)... I really need a clean success to fix the generator! Can I push it?"
> **John**: "You can. Add **1d6** to the total to try and hit 12+, but if you roll a **1** on that die, you panic."
> **Mary**: "I have to try. Come on..." *(Rolls d6)* "I got a 4! Total is 15. Tier 2 Success!"
> **John**: "You wipe the sweat from your brow. The generator hums to life."
