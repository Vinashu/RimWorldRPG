# Chapter 8: The Storyteller (GM Section)

Welcome, Storyteller. You are the architect of chaos, the hand of fate, and the voice of the Rim itself. This chapter provides you with the tools to run engaging, challenging, and memorable RimWorld TTRPG sessions.

---

## Part 1: Running the Game

### Your Role as Storyteller
You are not the players' enemy—you are their **narrator** and **challenge designer**. Your job is to:
*   **Create Drama**: Introduce threats, opportunities, and moral dilemmas.
*   **Be Fair**: Don't fudge dice to kill characters, but don't pull punches either.
*   **Embrace Chaos**: RimWorld is about emergent stories. Let the dice and player choices drive the narrative.

### Pacing and Tone
RimWorld alternates between **quiet colony-building** and **explosive crises**.

**The Colony Phase** (Downtime):
*   Players assign colonists to tasks (farming, crafting, research).
*   Use this time for character development, social interactions, and planning.
*   Duration: 3-7 in-game days per session.

**The Crisis Phase** (Events):
*   Introduce threats: raids, disasters, or opportunities.
*   Keep combat fast and brutal.
*   Duration: 1-2 hours of real-time play.

**Balance**: Aim for a 60/40 split (60% colony-building, 40% crisis). Adjust based on player preference.

## Part 2: Storyteller Personas

Choose a Storyteller persona to guide your event pacing. You can switch personas between sessions or campaigns.

### Cassandra Classic
*   **Style**: Steady escalation. Predictable but relentless.
*   **Pacing**: Events occur every 4-6 days. Major threats scale with colony wealth.
*   **Best For**: New players who want a fair, balanced challenge.

**Event Frequency**:
*   **Days 1-10**: Minor events only.
*   **Days 11-30**: Mix of Minor and Major events.
*   **Days 31+**: All event types, weighted by wealth.

### Randy Random
*   **Style**: Pure chaos. Anything can happen at any time.
*   **Pacing**: Roll for an event every 2-3 days. Ignore wealth scaling.
*   **Best For**: Experienced players who want unpredictability.

**Event Frequency**:
*   Roll **1d6** every 2-3 days:
    *   **1-2**: Minor event.
    *   **3-4**: Major event.
    *   **5-6**: Extreme event (even on Day 1!).

### Phoebe Chillax
*   **Style**: Relaxed. Long breaks between threats.
*   **Pacing**: Events occur every 8-12 days. Gentle difficulty curve.
*   **Best For**: Players who want to focus on base-building and roleplay.

**Event Frequency**:
*   **Days 1-20**: Minor events only, infrequent.
*   **Days 21+**: Occasional Major events. Extreme events are rare.

## Part 6: Wealth Management

Colony wealth determines threat level. As players accumulate resources, enemies grow stronger.

### Calculating Wealth
**Wealth** = (Buildings + Items + Colonists) in Silver value.
*   **Buildings**: 100 Silver per structure.
*   **Items**: Market Value (see Chapter 5).
*   **Colonists**: 1,500 Silver each.

### Threat Scaling
Use wealth to scale enemy strength:

| Wealth | Threat Level | Enemy Count | Enemy Quality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-2,000** | **Low** | 3-5 enemies | Tribal, weak gear. |
| **2,001-5,000** | **Medium** | 5-8 enemies | Pirates, basic guns. |
| **5,001-10,000** | **High** | 8-12 enemies | Mixed gear, some armor. |
| **10,001-20,000** | **Very High** | 12-18 enemies | Advanced weapons, Mechanoids. |
| **20,001+** | **Extreme** | 20+ enemies | Siege weapons, Centipedes, Elite Mercs. |

### Balancing Tips
*   **Don't Punish Success**: Wealth scaling should challenge, not punish. If players are struggling, reduce event frequency.
*   **Reward Preparation**: If players invest in defenses (turrets, walls), let those defenses work.
*   **Vary Threats**: Don't just send bigger raids. Use environmental disasters, infestations, and social challenges.

## Part 7: Final Advice

### Embrace Failure
RimWorld stories are best when things go wrong. A colonist's death, a failed defense, a mental break—these create drama. Don't save players from consequences, but give them tools to recover.

### Let Players Drive
If players want to focus on trading instead of combat, let them. If they want to raid pirates, support it. The best sessions emerge from player agency.

### Use the Story Die
The Story Die (1d10) is your secret weapon. It turns predictable events into memorable moments. A "1" on a raid roll might mean the raiders brought a Doomsday Rocket Launcher. A "10" might mean they're drunk and disorganized.

### Have Fun
You're not writing a novel—you're facilitating chaos. Laugh at disasters, celebrate victories, and remember: **every scar tells a story**.
