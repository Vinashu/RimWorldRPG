# Chapter 8: The Storyteller (GM Section)

[Art: chapter_art/ch08_storyteller_01.png
Purpose: Chapter opener setting the GM-as-storyteller tone]

Welcome, Storyteller. You are the architect of chaos, the hand of fate, and the voice of the Rim itself. This chapter provides tools to run engaging, challenging, and memorable RimWorld RPG sessions.

---

## Part 1: Running the Game

### Your Role as Storyteller

**When it applies**
All sessions.

**How it works**
* **Create Drama**: Introduce threats, opportunities, and moral dilemmas.
* **Be Fair**: Don’t fudge dice to kill characters, but don’t pull punches either.
* **Embrace Chaos**: Let player choices and the Story Die drive the narrative.

**Example: Storyteller Role**
A raid starts small, but a **Story Die 10** complication adds a second wave and forces a hard choice.

Purpose: Reinforce the “director of drama” role]

---

### Pacing and Tone

**When it applies**
When planning session structure.

**How it works**
* **Colony Phase** (Downtime): Assign tasks, roleplay, plan. **3–7 in-game days per session**.
* **Crisis Phase** (Events): Raids, disasters, quests. **1–2 hours of real-time play**.
* **Balance**: Aim for **60/40** (colony/crisis).

[Art: diagrams/ch08_pacing_split_01.png
Purpose: Visualize the 60/40 colony vs crisis pacing split]

**Example: Pacing**
You run two colony days, then drop a raid, then return to building and social scenes.

## Part 2: Storyteller Personas

### Cassandra Classic

**When it applies**
When using steady escalation.

**How it works**
* Events every **4–6 days**.
* Major threats scale with **Wealth Score**.

**Event Frequency**
* **Days 1–10**: Minor events only.
* **Days 11–30**: Mix of Minor and Major events.
* **Days 31+**: All event types, weighted by wealth.

**Example: Cassandra**
On Day 14 with a stable colony, roll a **Minor** or **Major** event.

---

### Randy Random

**When it applies**
When using chaotic pacing.

**How it works**
* Roll for an event every **2–3 days**.
* Sometimes ignore wealth scaling.

**Event Frequency**
Roll **1d20**:
* **1–5**: Minor event.
* **6–18**: Nothing happens.
* **19**: Major event.
* **20**: Extreme event (even on Day 1).

**Example: Randy**
On Day 3 you roll a **20**. An **Extreme Event** hits even though the colony is new.

---

### Phoebe Chillax

**When it applies**
When using relaxed pacing.

**How it works**
* Events every **8–12 days**.
* Gentle difficulty curve.

**Event Frequency**
* **Days 1–20**: Minor events only, infrequent.
* **Days 21+**: Occasional Major events. Extreme events are rare.

**Example: Phoebe**
You run two weeks of colony building with only one Minor event.

When the Storyteller persona calls for an event.

**How it works**
Roll on the table that matches your event type.

**Example: Event Frequency**
Using Cassandra, Day 15 calls for a **Major Event** roll.

---

### Minor Events

**When it applies**
When a Minor event is triggered.

**How it works**
Roll **1d10** or choose.

| d10 | Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Cargo Pods (Food)** | Free meals fall from the sky. +20 Meals. |
| **2** | **Cargo Pods (Materials)** | Free resources. +50 Steel or +30 Components. |
| **3** | **Wanderer Joins** | A stranger asks to join. Roll a random colonist. |
| **4** | **Eclipse** | Total darkness for 1 day. Solar power fails. Mood penalty. |
| **5** | **Solar Flare** | Electronics disabled for 2 hours. Turrets offline. |
| **6** | **Mad Animal** | 1 animal goes berserk. Attacks nearest colonist. |
| **7** | **Visitor Group** | Friendly faction visits. Opportunity to trade or socialize. |

| **9** | **Quest Offer** | Faction requests aid (see Quests). |
| **10** | **Inspiration** | 1 colonist gains **Edge** on all rolls for 1 day. |

**Edge cases**
* Recruitment rules are in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Minor Event**
A **Trade Caravan** arrives, giving the colony a chance to sell excess cloth.

---

### Major Events

**When it applies**
When a Major event is triggered.

**How it works**
Roll **1d10** or choose.

| d10 | Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Raid (Tribal)** | Tribal warriors. Cost: **5 pts** each. |
| **2** | **Raid (Pirate)** | Pirates with guns. Cost: **10 pts** each. |
| **3** | **Manhunter Pack** | Animals attack. **Warg (10 pts)** or **Boar (5 pts)**. |

**Edge cases**
* Enemy stats are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Major Event**
A **Raid (Pirate)** costs **10 pts** per gunner, so a 30-point raid could bring three gunners.

---

### Extreme Events

**How it works**
Roll **1d6** or choose.

| d6 | Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Raid (Mechanoid)** | Kill-bots. **Lancer (15 pts)**, **Scyther (20 pts)**. |

### Story Die Integration

**When it applies**
After determining an event.

**How it works**
Roll the **Story Die (1d10)**:
* **1 (Twist of Fate)**: Event has a silver lining (bonus loot, early warning).
* **10 (Complication)**: Event is worse than expected (more enemies, longer duration).

**Example: Story Die**
A raid triggers and the Story Die shows **1**. The raiders arrive late, giving the colony time to prepare.

---

## Part 5: Quests

### Quest Types

**When it applies**
When the Storyteller offers a quest.

**How it works**
Choose a quest type and run the listed challenge and reward.

**1. Rescue Mission**
* **Setup**: A faction member is captured or injured.
* **Challenge**: Travel, fight captors, escort survivor back.
* **Reward**: +15 Goodwill, possible recruit.

**2. Trade Request**
* **Setup**: A faction needs specific items.
* **Challenge**: Deliver goods via caravan.
* **Reward**: +10 Goodwill, Silver payment (150% of item value).

**3. Raid Assistance**
* **Setup**: Ally faction is under attack.
* **Challenge**: Travel and defend their base.
* **Reward**: +25 Goodwill, bonus trade goods.

**4. Artifact Recovery**
* **Setup**: An ancient structure contains valuable tech.
* **Challenge**: Navigate traps and guardians.
* **Reward**: Advanced weapons, Components, or Psylink Neuroformer.

**Edge cases**
* Caravan rules are in [Chapter 4: Survival & Combat](chapter_04_combat_and_survival.md).

**Example: Quest**
The colony accepts a **Trade Request** and delivers **Medicine** for **+10 Goodwill** and extra Silver.

[Art: spot/ch08_quest_types_01.png
Purpose: Visual cue for the four quest types]

---

### Quest Frequency

**When it applies**
When determining how often to offer quests.

**How it works**
Offer **1 quest every 10–15 days**. Repeated refusals may lower Goodwill.

**Example: Quest Frequency**
After declining two requests, the faction reduces Goodwill by **-10**.

---

## Part 6: Wealth Score Management

### Calculating Wealth Score

**When it applies**
When scaling threats.

**How it works**
**Wealth Score = Tech Points + Building Points + Defense Points + Colonist Points**

**Edge cases**
* Point values are defined in [Chapter 6: Colony Management](chapter_06_colony.md).

**Example: Wealth Score**
The colony’s points total **50**, so raid points are **50**.

---

### Threat Points System

**When it applies**
When building raids from a budget.

**How it works**
1. **Wealth Score = Raid Points**.
2. Spend Raid Points to buy enemies.

| Wealth Score | Raid Points | Example Raid (Tribal) | Example Raid (Mech) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **15 (Start)** | **15 pts** | 3 Warriors (5 pts ea) | 1 Lancer (15 pts) |
| **30 (Early)** | **30 pts** | 6 Warriors | 1 Scyther, 1 Lancer |
| **50 (Mid)** | **50 pts** | 10 Warriors | 2 Scythers, 1 Lancer |
| **100 (Late)** | **100 pts** | 20 Warriors | 1 Centipede, 2 Scythers |

**Enemy Costs (Approx)**
* **Tribal Warrior**: 5 pts
* **Pirate Gunner**: 10 pts
* **Elite Mercenary**: 25 pts
* **Warg / Wolf**: 10 pts
* **Lancer**: 15 pts
* **Scyther**: 20 pts
* **Centipede**: 60 pts

[Art: diagrams/ch08_threat_points_01.png
Purpose: Show Wealth Score converting to Raid Points and enemy costs]

**Edge cases**
* Enemy stat blocks are in [Chapter 7: The Rim](chapter_07_world.md).

**Example: Threat Points**
A 50-point raid could be **10 Tribal Warriors** or **2 Scythers + 1 Lancer**.

---

### Balancing Tips

**When it applies**
When tuning difficulty.

**How it works**
* Don’t punish success; use scaling to challenge, not crush.
* Reward preparation (defenses should matter).
* Vary threat types beyond raids.

**Example: Balance**
If players are struggling, reduce event frequency or offer a relief quest.

---

## Part 7: Final Advice

### Embrace Failure

**When it applies**
When players fail or lose characters.

**How it works**
Let consequences stand, but provide recovery opportunities.

**Example: Failure**
A colonist dies in a raid. The next week, a refugee Medic arrives as a possible recruit.

---

### Let Players Drive

**When it applies**
When players choose unexpected goals.

**How it works**
Support player-driven objectives and adjust events to match.

**Example: Player Drive**
If players focus on trade, introduce caravans and trade quests instead of constant raids.

---

### Use the Story Die

**When it applies**
During key events.

**How it works**
Let a **Story Die 1** create opportunity and a **Story Die 10** create pressure.

**Example: Story Die Use**
A Story Die **10** during a raid means the raiders brought a doomsday launcher.

---

### Have Fun

**When it applies**
Always.

**How it works**
Keep the pace sharp, the stakes clear, and the choices meaningful.

**Example: Have Fun**
End the session on a cliffhanger and ask players what they want to tackle next.
